AN RIGHTS2012
The Amnesty International Report 2012 documents the state of human rights in 155 countries and territories in 2011.
Throughout the year the demand for human rights resounded around the globe.
The year began with protests in countries where freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were routinely repressed. But by the end of the year, discontent and outrage at the failure of governments to ensure justice, security and human dignity had ignited protests across the world.
A common strand linking these protests, whether in Cairo or New York, was how quick governments were  to prevent peaceful protest and silence dissent. Those who took to the streets displayed immense courage in the face of often brutal crackdowns and overwhelming use of lethal force. 
In a year of unrest, transition and conflict, too many people are still denied their most basic rights. As demands for better governance and respect for human rights grow, this report shows that world leaders have yet to rise to the challenge.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT 2012
PART ONE: REGIONAL OVERVIEWS
AFRICA regional oVerVieWS africa
The brutal suppression  of demonstrations during2011 illustrated how the region’s political leaders learned little from what happened to their peers  in the north.  regional oVerVieWS africa
Security forces used  live ammunition against anti-government protesters, resulting  in many casualties. only very rarely were individuals held to account for committing human rights violations. as a result, people have lost confidence in law enforcement agencies and the judiciary in many countries in the region.  regional oVerVieWS africa
Discrimination against people based on their perceived or real sexual orientation or gender identity worsened.
Politicians often used statements or actions  to incite discrimination and persecution based  on perceived sexual orientation.  regional oVerVieWS africa
The question is whether africa’s political leadership will embrace these changes or see them as a threat to their hold on power. in 2011, most political leaders – in their reactions to protests and dissent – were part of the problem, not the solution.  regional oVerVieWS africa
AMERICAS  regional oVerVieWS aMericaS navy captain alfredo astiz and 15 others were sentenced to prison terms of between 18 years and life for their role in 86 crimes against humanity during the 1970s.  regional oVerVieWS aMericaS law enforcement practices in Brazil continued to be characterized by discrimination, human rights abuses, corruption and military-style policing.
There was evidence that in a number of cases the
Dominican police had adopted a shoot-to-kill policy, rather than trying to arrest unarmed suspects. regional oVerVieWS aMericaS
The long-running internal armed conflict in colombia continued to inflict untold misery on civilian communities across the country.  nearly two years after US
President Barack obama’s deadline to close the guantánamo detention facility, more than 150 men were still held there. regional oVerVieWS aMericaS in Brazil, colombia, guatemala, and Mexico, indigenous Peoples were forced off their lands, often violently.
The families of disappeared migrants carried out nationwide marches to press for action to locate their relatives. regional oVerVieWS
XXXXXXXXaMericaS
ASIA-PACIFIC  regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pacific
Success of uprisings  in Tunisia and egypt inspired human rights defenders, activists, and journalists in asia to raise their own voices, using  a combination of new technologies and  old-fashioned activism  to challenge violations  of their rights.  regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pacific regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pac fic in north Korea, those deviating from official ideology could end  up spending the rest  their lives in a bleak  and remote political prison camp. in indonesia, the police were criticized for failing to stop a 1,500-person mob from attacking the ahmadiyya community  in february, killing three and injuring many more.  regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pacific
The decades-old conflicts between the government of Myanmar and  various ethnic armed groups flared up again significantly. government forces fought insurgents, displacing tens of thousands of civilians  and committing violations that amounted to war crimes. impunity for past violations haunted many countries in the region, particularly those grappling with the legacy of conflicts. The failure  to provide justice complicated reconciliation efforts and often established a pattern  of injustice and lack of accountability for security forces.  regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pacific insecurity, natural disasters, poverty, and lack of suitable opportunities drove hundreds of thousands  of people to seek better lives elsewhere. 
Perhaps the most significant potential advance in terms of the region’s human rights situation was the decision by the authorities in
Myanmar to free more than 300 political prisoners during the year.  regional oVerVieWS aSia-Pacific
EUROPE AND 
CENTRAL ASIA   regional oVerVieWS eUroPe anD  cenTral aSia in azerbaijan,  anti-government demonstrations were effectively outlawed,  and attempts by a small number of government critics prompted a  fresh wave of repression and intimidation. regional oVerVieWS eUroPe anD  cenTral aSia
Detention as a tool of deterrence and control was a widespread, rather than a last, legitimate, resort.  instead of counteracting stereotypes and prejudices that fuel intolerance and hatred, some governments and public officials actually strengthened them. regional oVerVieWS eUroPe anD  cenTral aSia
Discussions on general prohibitions of full face veils were pursued in many countries across the region. invoking technicalities and state secrecy, lithuania abruptly closed its investigation in January into two secret detention facilities established  on lithuanian territory  by the cia.  regional oVerVieWS eUroPe anD  cenTral aSia
The use of unreliable diplomatic assurances to deport people considered a risk to national security proliferated across the region. incidents of torture remained widely reported in Ukraine and in russia, despite superficial police reforms in the latter. regional oVerVieWS eUroPe anD  cenTral aSia
The arrests of ratko
Mladić and goran Hadžić sent out a powerful message not only to those affected, but across the wider region.
MIDDLE EAST AND
NORTH AFRICA  regional oVerVieWS
MiDDle eaST anD norTH africa2011 was marked by mass demands for greater liberty to speak and to act, free from  the suffocating fear of state repression. regional oVerVieWS

Protesters in egypt provoked the downfall of President Mubarak  in the face of extreme repression by the security forces. at least840 people were killed.  regional oVerVieWS
MiDDle eaST anD norTH africa
By the end of the year libya was awash with arms and armed militias which carried out reprisals against suspected  al-gaddafi loyalists and presented a continuing threat to public security. regional oVerVieWS

The offer of immunity from prosecution to the Yemeni
President was an affront to justice and a betrayal of the victims of his regime’s crimes.
Syria’s government tried to conceal both the extent of the protests and the violence of its response but was largely thwarted due to the courage of local activists. regional oVerVieWS

ORLD’S HUM
AN RIGHTS2012
The Amnesty International Report 2012 documents the state of human rights in 155 countries and territories in 2011.
Throughout the year the demand for human rights resounded around the globe.
The year began with protests in countries where freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were routinely repressed. But by the end of the year, discontent and outrage at the failure of governments to ensure justice, security and human dignity had ignited protests across the world.
A common strand linking these protests, whether in Cairo or New York, was how quick governments were  to prevent peaceful protest and silence dissent. Those who took to the streets displayed immense courage in the face of often brutal crackdowns and overwhelming use of lethal force. 
In a year of unrest, transition and conflict, too many people are still denied their most basic rights. As demands for better governance and respect for human rights grow, this report shows that world leaders have yet to rise to the challenge.
