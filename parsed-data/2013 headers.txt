PREFACE“I NEVER IMAGINED THAT…TELLING THE  TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING COULD MEAN
WALKING THE LINE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH…
MANY TIMES I’VE FELT AS THOUGH FEAR HAS
SOAKED THROUGH TO MY BONES, BUT THE
FEELING OF RESPONSIBILITY IS STRONGER” 13 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT 2013
PART ONE: FOREWORD
HUMAN RIGHTS 
KNOW NO BORDERS
Salil Shetty, Secretary General
FOREWORD
ANNUAL REPORT 2013
States routinely claim sovereignty ... to hide  or deny mass murder, genocide, oppression, corruption, starvation,  or gender-based persecution. 
Governments should be learning from Indigenous communities in order to rethink the relationship with natural resources.
The most vulnerable  are the 12 million stateless people in the world, equivalent in numbers to the world’s great agglomerations such as London, Lagos  or Rio. And around 80% of them are women.
The arms trade also  has direct links to discrimination and gender-based violence, disproportionately affecting women. 
This has far-reaching implications for efforts to consolidate peace, security, gender  equality and secure development. 
We can demand that states ensure that all  the people they govern have meaningful access to the digital world.
Knowledge, information and the ability to speak are power. Rights respecting states do  not fear that power. 13
