WE HAVE BEEN HIT WITH A
DOUBLE MISFORTUNE.
FIRST WE HAD TO FLEE
BECAUSE OUR CITY CAME

HAVE NOWHERE TO

I WAS AT HOME WHEN A
YOUNG FARDC SOLDIER
CAME TO THE HOUSE...
THEN HE RAPED ME... I
WAS TOLD LATER THAT HE
WAS WHIPPED AS A
PUNISHMENT, BUT THE
SOLDIER IS STILL AT THE
CAMP AND I SEE HIM
REGULARLY. WHEN I SEE
HIM, HE TRIES TO JOKE
WITH ME. HE FRIGHTENS
ME. I FEEL VERY ANXIOUS
AND DEPRESSED. I WOULD
LIKE TO PRESS CHARGES,
BUT WHAT COULD I REALLY
DO TO A SOLDIER?

WHAT THIS PRIDE DID WAS TO DRIVE BULGARIAN
LGBT INTO THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOR THE WHOLE

THAT THEY WILL KILL US, THEY HAVE PREPARED
BOMBS WITH NAILS AGAINST US... NEVERTHELESS,
THE FEAR, THE FEELING OF COMMUNITY, OF

AND THAT IS RESPECT FOR

It reveals a world where systemic discrimination and insecurity hamper full implementation of progress made in law; where equality and human rights remain good intentions as opposed to good practice. It reveals also a world where states too often pick and choose the rights they will uphold, and those they will suppress.
The heart of the book is a country-by-country survey of human rights, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Overwhelmingly, the entries show how improvements in the lives of millions of people are fragile – at best – when states ignore or repress any of the rights laid out in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
As 2008 wore on, the world saw wave after wave of popular protest by the hungry, the impoverished and the excluded.
Too often such protests were met with excessive force and repression – governments unready to listen to the voices of the people. With this report, Amnesty International adds its voice to those who speak out against injustice and inequality, who courageously demand a future where all people will be free and equal, in rights and in dignity.
