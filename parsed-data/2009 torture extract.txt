Torture and other ill-treatment
There were allegations that detainees had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated, usually immediately after arrest and during questioning. In October the
Minister of Interior stated that, in the last three years,128  police officers had been reported by the Internal
Inspection Service to the prosecutor for “arbitrary acts” related to the use of violence.
However, very few of these cases went to court. In general, criminal proceedings were begun only if the victim filed a complaint or on the recommendation of the Ombudsperson. On one occasion, prosecutors and judges did not initiate investigations when a defendant bearing bruises was brought before them at a remand hearing. Prosecutors rarely, if ever, brought charges of torture, preferring to invoke lighter offences such as “arbitrary acts”, which in practice are generally punished with fines.
In January, the functions of the national mechanism for the prevention of torture, under the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against
Torture, were entrusted to the Ombudsperson. In the course of unannounced inspections to police stations the Ombudsperson learned of, and made public, several instances of police ill-treatment. Following one such inspection in November, police in the town of
Shkoder initiated criminal proceedings against the
Ombudsperson, claiming that he had jeopardized an investigation by publicly referring to two judicial police officers and their alleged victim by their initials. 
In November an inquiry was initiated against a judicial police officer in Saranda on charges of “using violence during an investigation”. The officer was alleged to have beaten Aristil Glluçaj, aged 18, while interrogating him on 6 November, causing him to lose04

There were also allegations that detainees had been ill-treated by prison guards. In February the
Ministry of Interior’s Internal Inspection Service investigated complaints by prisoners at Peqin and
Lezhë prisons that guards had ill-treated them. The investigation concluded that the complaints were well- founded and the guards were disciplined.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Detainees held in connection with violent protests in the villages of Karzakhan and Demestan in March and April alleged that they were tortured and otherwise ill-treated by police. They said they were held incommunicado for a week during which they were made to stand for excessive periods, blindfolded and beaten. 
Fifteen people arrested in December 2007 and accused of burning a police car and stealing a weapon alleged that they were tortured. Five were sentenced to between five and seven years’ imprisonment by the
High Criminal Court in July; six were sentenced to one year in prison but were pardoned by the King; and four were acquitted. Among those acquitted was
Mohammad Mekki Ahmad, aged 20, who was detained incommunicado for 12 days at the Criminal
Investigations Department in Manama, where he alleges he was tortured by being suspended, beaten and subjected to electric shocks. A medical report, requested by the High Criminal Court and submitted to it in April, noted that some of the defendants had marks on their bodies which might have been caused by torture. The government failed to order an independent investigation into the torture allegations.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued reports of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials, particularly during expulsions of undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers whose asylum claims had been rejected. In November, the
UN Committee against Torture expressed concern at continuing allegations of ill-treatment, including ill- treatment with a racist element, by law enforcement officials. In February, the CERD had also expressed concern about racist ill-treatment and discrimination by law enforcement officials, including excessive use of force during expulsions. 
On 26 April, Ebenizer Sontsa, a rejected asylum- seeker from Cameroon, was forcibly restrained by several law enforcement officials during an attempted deportation from Brussels Airport. Following protests by other passengers at his treatment, the deportation was abandoned and he was returned to the immigration detention centre of Merksplas where he made a complaint of ill-treatment. A new deportation was scheduled for 9 May, but on 1 May Ebenizer Sontsa committed suicide. In December, the Public
Prosecutor closed the investigation into Ebenizer
Sontsa’s death. 
Serge Fosso, one of the passengers who protested at the treatment of Ebenizer Sontsa, was forcibly removed from the flight with two other passengers who had also protested, and was detained for 10 hours in a cell at
Brussels Airport where he said he was insulted and threatened by law enforcement officials, who then dragged him out of the cell in a headlock, resulting in injuries to his face, arms, fingers and back. He submitted a criminal complaint regarding the treatment he received, which was still under investigation at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Ill-treatment by the police and in prisons continued.
Impunity prevailed due to an ineffective complaints mechanism and lack of investigations by the prosecutors into allegations of ill-treatment.
Conditions of detention were below international standards. Of particular concern were conditions in the Zenica Prison Forensic Psychiatric Annexe, where patients with mental health problems lacked adequate medical assistance.
The police reform law passed in April failed to address the problem of police accountability.
========== BRAZIL ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Despite several government initiatives, including the recent ratification of the Optional Protocol to the
Convention against Torture, torture by law enforcement officials was still common at the point of arrest, during interrogation and in detention.
Reporting, investigation and prosecution of such cases under the 1997 Torture Law were rare. 
In Piauí state, two military police officers from the 4th
Battalion in the city of Picos were accused of torturing two young men whom they had arrested in October on suspicion of theft. The men were beaten about the genitals and back. A medical examination revealed gross swelling of the testicles and extensive bruising. At the end of the year, two military police were on trial, and the commander of the battalion was removed from his post pending the outcome of investigations.
Many detention centres were dominated internally by criminal gangs, and detainees were frequently tortured, ill-treated and sometimes killed by guards or other detainees. Some states continued to adopt a system of extended solitary confinement in high security prisons, in contravention of international standards. 
In September, three prisoners were found stabbed to death in the Paulo Sarasate detention centre, in
Fortaleza, Ceará state. A further two were burned alive in their cell in November. This brought the total of prisoner killings in the detention centre in 2008 to 18.
The authorities attributed these to gang conflicts within the prison.
In a landmark decision the Attorney General forwarded a petition to the Federal Supreme Court calling for federal intervention in Rondônia state to prevent systematic violations committed in the José
Mário Alves prison, known as Urso Branco. The request came after eight years of reports – by national and local NGOs, Global Justice and The Peace and
Justice Commission – of violations including summary executions and torture.
There were continuing reports of ill-treatment and abuses in the juvenile detention system. 
In July, in São Paulo’s Fundação CASA detention system (Centro de Atendimento Socioeducativo ao
Adolescente) detainees in the Complexo de Franco da
Rocha alleged that in the aftermath of a riot, they were locked in their cells and beaten with batons, bits of wood studded with nails, iron bars and the shaft of a hoe. 
In November in Rio de Janeiro’s DEGASE detention system (Departamento Geral de Ações Socioeducativas), a 17-year-old boy died of head injuries sustained in the
Educandário Santo Expedito detention centre in
Bangu. Witesses reported that the boy had been beaten by guards. A police inquiry was launched.
========== BULGARIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In February, the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) issued a report on its visit to Bulgaria in September 2006 stating that efforts should be increased to combat ill-treatment of detainees and to improve detention facilities.
In April, the BHC denounced the non-compliance with international standards of legislation covering the use of firearms by law enforcement officials. The BHC also reported on cases of ill-treatment by police officials, in particular towards Roma, at the time of arrest or during detention. These were often not adequately investigated. 
On 2 October, Sofia’s Military Court sentenced five police officers to a total of 82 years’ imprisonment after convicting them of beating 38-year-old Angel Dimitrov to death in 2005. His death was initially explained by the police as the result of a heart attack, but a second autopsy demanded by relatives showed that he had died from blows to the head. An appeal against the decision, to be reviewed by the Military Court of
Appeals, was pending at the end of the year. Sofia’s
Military Court had previously issued a sentence against the five police officers in November 2007, but the decision was repealed by the Military Court of Appeals.
Ill-treatment in custody
In February the CPT reported overcrowding and verbal abuse against inmates in prison facilities visited in 2006, as well as allegations of physical ill-treatment by prison staff.
The BHC also reported that conditions in many prisons continued to be below those required by international standards. 
On 6 March, Bulgaria was found by the European
Court of Human Rights to be in violation of the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment. Nikolai
Kirilov Gavazov, a prisoner accused of rape, spent nearly two years on remand in a tiny, windowless cell in
Pazardjik prison, central Bulgaria. The Court also found that the seven-year length of the court case was excessive.
Mental health institutions
In February the CPT, following visits to mental health and social care institutions in 2006, raised serious concerns about admission procedures, ill-treatment and living conditions at the institutions visited.
The CPT highlighted the lack of staff, staff training and resources in such institutions, conditions which had led to violent incidents, limited therapeutic options and insufficient provision of rehabilitation programmes. Despite recommendations by the CPT in 2002 that attention be given to improving living conditions, these remained inadequate.
In February, following a BBC television documentary highlighting extremely poor conditions04

In January, the UK television channel BBC One broadcast secret footage of the use of “cage beds” for young people with severe mental and physical disabilities in several social care homes. The use of enclosed restraint beds for psychiatric patients continued. By the end of 2008 the authorities had still not announced any intention to discontinue the use of“net  beds”, despite calls from the UNHRC in April for them to be abolished. The National Defender of
Rights (Ombudsperson) made unannounced visits to psychiatric institutions in the first half of the year.
The visits revealed that restraint beds were being used in geriatric psychiatric units, not only in situations of acute endangerment but also as long- term solutions.

Torture, other ill-treatment and arbitrary detention
Torture and ill-treatment were routinely committed by government security services and armed groups, directed particularly against perceived political opponents. Methods included beatings, stabbings, suspension from grilles or window bars and rape in custody.
There were regular arbitrary arrests by state security forces, especially of military or police officers with suspected affiliations to the Mouvement de
Libération du Congo (MLC) political opposition and its leader, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, or of individuals suspected of supporting the CNDP. Many detainees were held incommunicado for weeks or months in unofficial military or intelligence service detention.
Conditions in most detention centres and prisons were poor and constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Deaths of prisoners from malnutrition or treatable illnesses were regularly reported.

Torture and other ill-treatment were systematic in police stations, prisons and SSI detention centres.
Impunity continued for most perpetrators, exacerbated by police threatening victims with re-arrest or the arrest of relatives if they lodged complaints. However, some alleged torturers were brought to trial during the year. 
In October, Mervat Abdel Salam died after police officers raided her home in Samalut, Minya
Governorate, and beat her during a robbery inquiry.
Although she was pregnant and bleeding, police officers were reported to have locked her in the house, delaying medical assistance. Her family complained to the Public Prosecutor, who ordered an investigation, but the initial forensic medical report concluded that there were no external signs of violence despite injuries visible to her family. Lawyers for the family requested04

A number of deaths in custody, apparently as a result of torture and other ill-treatment, were reported. 
Ali Muhammad Muhammad Abd-al-Salam died in
Asyut Prison in Upper Egypt on 8 September. Fellow prisoners said a prison guard had assaulted and killed him. The Interior Ministry said he had died while held in solitary confinement following a quarrel with other prisoners.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were fewer reports of torture and other ill- treatment of political detainees. However, suspected criminals continued to be tortured or otherwise ill- treated with impunity in police stations.
A female police officer arrested in November 2007 in connection with the death in Nsuemang, Ebebiyin district, of Lázaro Ondo Obiang on 29 September2007,  was tried before a military court in Bata in
February. Lázaro Ondo Obiang died as a result of beatings by four police officers, who apparently acted on her orders. She was convicted and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. A senior police officer who had been accused of torturing other detainees in Bata police station and had reportedly been arrested in
November 2007 was one of the judges.
Two soldiers arrested in November 2007 in connection with the death of Salvador Ndong
Nguema in Evinayong prison in 2007 were released untried in February and resumed their duties. 
Saturnino Ncogo, a former member of the banned
Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea (PPGE), died in Black Beach prison on 12 March. He had been arrested a few hours earlier after three weapons were found hidden in his house. The authorities claimed he committed suicide by throwing himself from the top of a bunk bed. There was no investigation and an autopsy was not carried out. His relatives said that the body was in an advanced state of decomposition by the time they received it, three days later, and that he had a fractured skull.
========== ERITREA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Conditions of detention in Eritrea remained harsh and prisoners were regularly tortured or otherwise ill- treated. A common reported method of punishment over recent years has been tying detainees in painful positions known as the “helicopter” and the “eight”.
Prisoners have also frequently been left exposed to the sun for extended periods, or locked in metal shipping containers which magnify extremes of heat and cold. Many detainees were held in secret prisons and some in security prisons such as Karchele in
Asmara. Many prisoners were held in crowded underground cells without access to daylight.
Conditions were unhygienic and damp, with no water for washing or cleaning. Prisoners were underfed and received unclean drinking water. There was almost no medical assistance available. 
In February local sources reported the death in prison of Muslim leader Taha Mohammed Nur, co- founder of the ELF. 
Teklesenbet Gebreab Kiflom, a member of the evangelical Full Gospel Church, reportedly died in Wia military prison in October after being denied treatment for malaria. Another evangelical Christian, Azib Simon, was reported to have died in similar circumstances in
June.

Ill-treatment by police of detainees, particularly migrants and members of marginalized groups, was reported throughout the year. 
Migrants arriving on the island of Samos were reported to have been ill-treated by coastguard officers after their arrest on 7 July. The migrants said they were slapped, punched and kicked on the coastguards’ boat. A guard allegedly poured sun-protecting lotion down a man’s throat, while another migrant was grabbed by the hair and his head knocked against the side of the boat. A third male migrant was reported to have suffered a ruptured eardrum after being slapped.
An investigation into the allegations had not been concluded by the end of the year. An investigation into ill-treatment of migrants on Chios island ordered in
October 2007 had also not been concluded. 
On 26 October police officers outside the Aliens
Directorate in Athens attacked a crowd of asylum- seekers waiting to file applications, killing one man and injuring several others, according to the Athens-based
Group of Lawyers for the Rights of Migrants and
Refugees. The Directorate had reportedly been refusing to accept new applications for the previous two months. 
A Romani man detained on 19 June said he was beaten at Aharnon police station for several hours after arrest. 
On 16 October, three police officers were fined and suspended from duty for up to six months by the police
Appeals Disciplinary Council for their part in the beating of a Cypriot student, Avgoustinos Demetriou, on 17
November 2006 in Thessaloniki. Avgoustinos Demetriou was seriously injured as a result of the beating. Four police officers present during the incident but who had not taken part in the beating were acquitted.
In February the report was published of the
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s(CPT) 2007  visit to the country. The report noted a serious breach of Articles 3 and 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) relating to the prohibition of torture and respect for privacy. The CPT reported inhuman and degrading conditions in some border guard stations and numerous allegations of ill- treatment. It noted that the rights of detained migrants to have access to a lawyer and to inform their families about their detention were not effective in practice, while access to medical care was limited.

Torture and other ill-treatment
The authorities failed to include torture as a crime in its Criminal Code or to introduce an effective police accountability mechanism. There were continued allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials, particularly towards migrants. 
The trial in the case of the death of Federico
Aldrovandi continued. Federico Aldrovandi died on 25
September 2005 after being stopped by four police officers, who were subsequently accused of voluntary manslaughter. On 25 November, new evidence appeared suggesting Federico Aldrovandi’s death was caused by the method of restraint used by the police, which restricted his breathing and led to cardiorespiratory arrest. 
There were developments in the case of Aldo
Bianzino, who died in October 2007 in prison in
Perugia two days after his arrest. A medical check just after his arrest had revealed that he was in perfect health. An autopsy revealed a brain haemorrhage and ruptured liver. The Public Prosecutor initiated legal proceedings against unidentified people for manslaughter and against a prison guard for failing to come to Aldo Bianzino’s help. His family was convinced that he died because of ill-treatment while in detention.
In February 2008, further forensic tests ordered by the
Public Prosecutor concluded that he had died of natural causes – a brain aneurysm. The Public
Prosecutor asked for the manslaughter case to be closed, which was opposed by Aldo Bianzino’s family.
In October 2008, the judge ruled that the case should not be closed. 
On 29 September, Emmanuel Bonsu, a Ghanaian citizen, was arrested and reportedly beaten by municipal police officers in Parma, resulting in damage to his eye. He was released after four hours. Ten police officers were charged with kidnapping, ill-treatment and abuse of power, among other things.
G8 trials
Trials against demonstrators and law enforcement officials involved in the policing of the G8 summit in
Genoa in 2001 continued. 
In January, the Ministry of Interior was ordered to pay€35,000  to M.P., a doctor who was severely beaten by law enforcement officers in Genoa in 2001. 
Fifteen people, including police officers, prison guards and doctors, were sentenced to prison terms of up to five years after being found guilty on 14 July of abuse of office and ill-treating protesters detained in
Bolzaneto prison. In November, the judge admitted that he could only sentence the accused on lesser charges, since torture is not a criminal offence in the penal code.
It was unlikely that any of those sentenced would actually serve time in prison because their offences would expire under Italy’s statute of limitations before the completion of the appeal process. 
Thirteen law enforcement officials were found guilty on 13 November of ill-treating protesters staying at the
Armando Diaz School, defamation and planting evidence, among other charges. Those found guilty, along with the Ministry of Interior, would be responsible for paying reparations to the victims. The sentences handed down by the Italian court ranged from one month to four years’ imprisonment.

Firas al-‘Utti, Hazim Ziyada and Ibrahim al-‘Ulayan were reported to have died in a fire on 14 April when guards at Muwaqqar Prison forced them to remain in their cell. Two of them had allegedly been tortured by being beaten and suspended from a wall with their hands tied behind their back. The Public Security
Department was reported to have held an investigation into the deaths but its outcome was not disclosed and no prosecutions were known to have been initiated. 
Two prison officers were each sentenced to 30 months in prison by a police court in May for beating
Firas Zaidan to death in May 2007 in Aqaba Prison. A third prison officer was acquitted.
In February, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture reported that the authorities had failed to implement“effective  mechanisms” to prevent torture and other ill-treatment or to ensure prosecution of perpetrators, which he had called for following his visit to Jordan in2006.

In March, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, reporting on a visit in December 2007, strongly criticized the authorities for failing to investigate fully allegations of ill-treatment of detainees by law enforcement officials and prison staff, and improve detention conditions in police stations and prisons. Conditions had been found on some occasions to be inhuman and degrading.
The Committee reported allegations of deliberate physical ill-treatment of detainees by prison staff at
Daugavpils Prison and Riga Central Prison. The
Committee also received reports of psychological ill- treatment, such as prison staff verbally abusing detainees and threatening to put inmates in cells with other inmates prone to violence.
The Committee expressed particular concern at the allegations of frequent and severe inter-prisoner violence in various prisons. These included severe beating, sexual assault (including rape) and threats.
The Committee highlighted the case of a juvenile prisoner in the Šķirotava Prison in Riga who had been repeatedly raped by fellow inmates. The Committee expressed concern that the staff had apparently been aware of the situation, but had failed to take effective steps to protect the minor.

January 2006, they were charged with “plotting to commit terrorist acts”. In court, several of the defendants repudiated “confessions” made while held in pre-trial detention at the Information Branch of the
Internal Security Department in Beirut and alleged that they were given under “police brutality and torture”, but the court failed to investigate their claims. Three of the defendants were released on bail on25 
September.

No investigations were carried out into credible reports that the majority of 316 suspected Fatah al-Islam members or sympathizers arrested in the wake of the May to September 2007 clashes in the
Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp were tortured in detention. Methods alleged included the ballanco (hanging by the wrists tied behind the back), electrocution, having a glass bottle forced into the anus, beatings and religious insults. Tens of detainees said that they gave “confessions” as a result.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In the absence of an independent oversight mechanism, allegations of torture and other ill- treatment were subject to internal investigations by the Interior Ministry, which failed to be independent or impartial. In February, for example, national television showed mobile phone footage, apparently taken by a police officer, of the bruised and bloody face of a man detained in Brodec in November 2007 during Operation Mountain Storm. While police officers responsible for the footage were suspended pending investigation, the Interior Minister refused to re-open an internal investigation into the incident, in which six people were killed and others allegedly ill- treated by the police. 
In July, 17 men, including 13 of those arrested in
Brodec, were convicted of armed attacks against the police, preparation of a terrorist act and weapons possession.
The European Court of Human Rights in April found Macedonia in violation of Article 3 of the
European Convention on Human Rights (freedom from torture) for failing to investigate the claim of five
Romani applicants that they had been ill-treated by police in 1998 in a restaurant in Štip and subsequently in detention.
In May the UN Committee against Torture highlighted concerns about the failure of the authorities to investigate allegations of torture and other ill- treatment; the continued absence of an independent external oversight mechanism to investigate and monitor alleged police misconduct; and the low penalties imposed on police officers convicted of torture and other ill-treatment. In April the UN Human
Rights Committee (HRC) had also expressed concerns about police violence against minorities, in particular
Roma, and the lack of effective investigation. The
Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of
Torture (CPT) noted similar concerns in its reports in
February and September.

During a mission to Mauritania, Amnesty International delegates met two Mauritanian citizens, who were arrested in Mali in late November 2007 and accused of being members of al-Qa’ida in the Maghreb. They were transferred to Mauritania in February 2008 where they remained in detention. The two men told
Amnesty International that they had been tortured in a secret detention centre in Bamako. Methods used included kicking, beating, electric shocks, suspension by the arms and sleep deprivation.
========== MALTA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be reported throughout 2008 in a wide variety of detention centres including the first police brigade and private villas in Nouakchott. Common methods included kicking, beating, electric shocks, cigarette burns, sexual violence, suspension by the arms, shackling in painful positions, and deprivation of sleep and food.
Restricted access to the outside world and failure to establish effective mechanisms for complaint and investigation continued to be key factors allowing torture to persist.
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment were recorded from scores of people including detainees at
Dar Naïm prison. Some detainees, especially alleged
Islamist activists, reported that they had been tortured with electric shocks. One said that he was given electric shocks on the soles of his feet. Another said that he was blindfolded, his hands and feet were tied behind his back and he was given electric shocks. A third told Amnesty International that the security forces urinated on him and inserted a truncheon in his anus.
========== MEXICO ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment remained widespread.
Despite various initiatives, there was little improvement in the effective prosecution of perpetrators. In August, the UN Subcommittee on
Prevention of Torture visited detention facilities in several states and received information on numerous cases of torture. The findings of the Subcommittee remained confidential. 
In February, Eliseo Silvano Espinoza and Eliseo
Silvano Jiménez, two Tzeltal Indigenous men, were detained in Chilón, Chiapas State, by the State Highway
Police. They were reportedly shot at, beaten, almost225Amnesty

suffocated, threatened and sprayed with tear gas to try to extract a confession. The two men were subsequently released without charge. Two police officers were in custody under investigation at the end of the year. 
In October, teachers and community supporters held protests in Morelos State. In the town of Xoxocotla federal police broke up protests on a main highway.
Many of those detained alleged they had been arrested in their homes, beaten and some forced to walk barefoot on hot cinders.
========== MOLDOVA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
On 14 March, the parliament passed a law which could help to prevent torture and reduce impunity for torture and other ill-treatment. Among the changes, the Criminal Procedural Code was amended so that the institution in which the alleged victim was detained had to prove that the torture and other ill- treatment did not occur. Previously, the burden of proof had lain with the victims, who had to prove that they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated.
The Consultative Council within the Parliamentary
Ombudsman’s office, which is intended to monitor places of detention in accordance with Moldova’s obligations under the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture, was functional by March.
However, concerns remained that the Council was not adequately funded or sufficiently independent from the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s office. There were continued reports of torture and other ill-treatment in police custody. 
In February, brothers Vasiliu and Petru Livadari were allegedly beaten by staff in Cricova prison because of their complaints about their treatment and conditions in prison. After they complained to the Ombudsman they were reportedly threatened that they would be beaten to death. On the insistence of the Ombudsman, the two prisoners were moved, but the prosecutors who227Amnesty

A-Z09:A-Z copy 1 26/03/2009 14:16 Page 227
arrived at Cricova prison to investigate the allegations tried to dissuade the brothers from making a complaint.
On 6 March, the Ministry of Justice, which has jurisdiction over the prison service in Moldova, stated that Vasiliu and Petru Livadari had been transferred to a prison hospital where they were receiving medical treatment, but that there was no evidence that they had been ill-treated. However, the Prosecutor General’s office announced on 4 April that two prison officers had been charged with torture under Article 309/1 of the Criminal Code. The case was ongoing at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There was no progress in the bringing to justice of those responsible for the alleged torture of some members of a group of ethnic Albanians arrested in September 2006 during Operation Orlov let(Eagle’s  flight).
Proceedings against the group of 12 men, including four US citizens, and five others had opened in May 2007 at Podgorica District Court.
The case was not conducted in accordance with international standards as the evidence against them included testimonies extracted under duress or unlawfully obtained. In August, 12 out of the 17 men were convicted of association for the purposes of terrorism and sentenced to prison terms of up to six and a half years. The others were convicted of possessing firearms and received suspended sentences, although the court subsequently ordered their detention.
In October, five members of the Special Anti-
Terrorist Unit involved in Operation Orlov let were convicted and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for the ill-treatment of Peter Sinistaj, father of one of the detainees.
Allegations of ill-treatment followed the arrest of more than 100 people involved in demonstrations in
October against Montenegro’s recognition of Kosovo; investigations were opened, including into allegations by Aleksandar Pejanović that he had been beaten with sticks by masked police officers.
Unlawful killings

Torture and other ill-treatment
Police routinely used torture and other ill-treatment against suspects. National laws providing safeguards against torture fell short of international standards, and remained inadequately implemented.
More than 1,300 new cases of torture had been recorded since April 2006. 
Police arrested Sumitra Khawas on 9 September near her home in the Morang District, and detained her at the
Belbari police station. She said that during her interrogation she was beaten repeatedly with the inner tube of a car tyre and punched all over her body. On 15
October, lawyers representing her filed a compensation claim for torture in custody but, at the end of the year no action had been taken against the perpetrators. Although she had been tried, no final verdict was given by the court and Sumitra Khawas remained in police custody.

Torture and other ill-treatment
The police frequently used torture and other ill- treatment when interrogating suspects and there was no standardized mechanism to prevent such practices. Confessions extracted under torture continued to be used as evidence in court, contrary to international law. 
In Owerri prison, a 68-year-old man said that police had shot him in the leg, flogged him with electric cables and put a powdery substance in his eyes. He had been in prison awaiting trial for 10 years, despite a medical report confirming his allegations of torture, which were not investigated.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Law enforcement and security agencies routinely used torture and other ill-treatment, including beating, prolonged standing, hanging by the ankles and rape. Several deaths in custody were reported.
========== PALESTINIAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In the West Bank, detainees complained that they had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated by the PA’s
General Intelligence and Preventive Security services, apparently to make them confess involvement with
Hamas’ armed wing. Methods alleged included beatings, suspension, and forcing detainees to sit or stand for prolonged periods in painful positions(shabeh). 
Majd al-Barghouthi, imam of a mosque in Kobar near Ramallah, was detained by the General
Intelligence on 14 February and died eight days later.
The PA stated that he had a heart attack, but fellow detainees said they had seen him being beaten and suspended by a chain from the ceiling of his cell. A fact- finding committee set up by members of the
Palestinian Legislative Council found that Majd al-Barghouthi had been tortured; photographs of his body substantiated their findings.
In Gaza, allegations of severe beatings and other torture of detainees by Hamas forces and militias were widespread. After the Israeli military offensive began in December, Hamas forces and militias sharply increased their attacks on political opponents, former members of the security forces in the PA government and former detainees alleged to have“collaborated”  with Israeli intelligence services. Some were summarily killed, others were shot in the legs or severely beaten. 
Taleb Mohammed Abu Sitta, 72, was detained in al-Zawaida on 26 June following the arrest of his son for an alleged drugs offence. He was reported to have been severely beaten and taken the following morning to hospital in Deir al-Balah, where he was declared dead on arrival. The Interior Ministry announced an inquiry and several police officers were reported to have been suspended from duty, but no one was known to have been tried.
Neither the PA in the West Bank nor Hamas in
Gaza took any credible measures to end impunity for torture and other ill-treatment of detainees or for excessive and unwarranted use of force by security forces against demonstrators.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials. In February, the UN
Committee against Torture expressed its concern about reports of torture and other ill-treatment in prisons and the excessive use of force, including the use of firearms, by law enforcement officials. It also expressed concern at the acquisition of Taser weapons by law enforcement agencies, stating that the pain such weapons inflict constituted a form of torture. 
In October, the trial began of four police officers charged with torturing Leonor Cipriano in 2004 to obtain a confession that she had killed her daughter.
Medical reports and photographs of Leonor Cipriano recorded extensive injuries after two days in police custody in Faro. Police officials said that she fell down a flight of stairs in the police station; however the Institute of
Forensic Medicine stated that her injuries were not consistent with such an incident and were more in keeping with an assault. Leonor Cipriano said that she was punched, kicked, had a plastic bag placed over head, and was forced to kneel on glass ashtrays during interrogations. The trial was ongoing at the end of the year. 
The Court of Appeal in Lisbon ordered a retrial in the case of Albino Libânio, who was assaulted by prison officers in Lisbon Prison in 2003. The Court granted a request by Albino Libânio’s lawyers for the Portuguese state to be named as a defendant. The decision was made on the grounds that, as his injuries occurred while he was in the care of the prison system, the state should be held liable even if it was impossible to prove which prison officers were responsible for the attack. The original trial had recognized the injuries suffered by Albino
Libânio but acquitted all seven prison officers of assault because of lack of evidence proving their responsibility. A new trial date had not been set at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners were reported from throughout the Russian Federation.
Methods detailed included beatings, electric shocks, suffocation with plastic bags and being forced to stay in painful positions for prolonged periods. There were also reports of rape in detention. Some detainees were denied necessary medical treatment.
A number of ethnic Ingush men were reported to have been abducted in Moscow in early September.
One of them stated that he was ill-treated while held for several days in a secret detention centre in the
Moscow region run by the Ministry of Defence. An investigation was opened and was continuing at the end of the year. 
Sergei Liapin from Nizhnii Novgorod was detained in
April as a suspect in connection with a spate of thefts; he strongly denied any involvement in the crimes. He stated that he was tortured in order to extract a confession. He said that police poured water over his body, applied electrodes to sensitive parts of the body, kicked and beat him. He was placed in a temporary holding cell overnight and was not transferred to hospital until the following day, by which time his condition had deteriorated.
In September, a law allowing public scrutiny of places of detention by selected individuals came into force. However, monitoring had not started by the end of the year.
Prisoners in several Russian prison colonies protested at their conditions of detention, which sometimes reportedly constituted inhuman or degrading treatment. Riots and hunger strikes were reported from several prison colonies in the Urals and the Volga Federal District. Prisoners complained about beatings and ill-treatment by prison officials and by other detainees and alleged that the prison273Amnesty

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be widespread and committed with impunity. Commonly cited methods included severe beatings with sticks, electric shocks, suspension from the ceiling, punching, sleep deprivation and insults. 
In March, three Chadian men – Muhammad Hamid
Ibrahim Sulayman, Hassan Bashir and Muhammad
Salih – were reported to have been convicted of theft and sentenced to have their right hands amputated on the basis of confessions allegedly made after they were beaten while held in prolonged incommunicado detention. 
A former detainee held without charge in various prisons between 2003 and 2006 told Amnesty
International in 2008 that he had been given electric shocks, held in solitary confinement for four months, and shackled for three weeks in a small cell without air conditioning during extremely hot weather.
========== SENEGAL ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There was no progress in investigations into the ill- treatment of detainees during a protest in Niš prison in December 2006; one detainee had died of his injuries. The NGO Leskovac Committee for Human
Rights submitted two applications to the European
Court of Human Rights in three torture-related cases.
Allegations of ill-treatment of ethnic Albanian prisoners continued to be reported.
Reports of police ill-treatment continued, including of journalists and Roma. In November the UN
Committee against Torture in their consideration of
Serbia’s report on its obligations under the Convention against Torture urged that the definition of torture in the criminal code be brought in line with that of the
Convention, and that an independent oversight mechanism be established.284

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment by police, prison warders and private security guards continued to be reported and sometimes led to the deaths of detainees. Corroborated cases included the use of electric shock and suffocation torture and prolonged assaults with batons, fists and booted feet. In several cases police interrogators and prison warders attempted to conceal evidence relating to the cause of death. Crime suspects, injured by anti-crime vigilante groups, were sometimes denied emergency medical care while held in police custody, leading in one case, in December, to the death of a detainee. 
S.N., a co-accused in a theft case, was assaulted by police in October when he went to report to the police station, as required under his bail conditions. He was pushed against a wall, punched, slapped and stamped on, while handcuffed and in leg-irons. He was threatened with being shot if he lodged a complaint.
A medical examination revealed injuries consistent with his allegations. 
Three Zimbabwean asylum-seekers were ill-treated by police officers in an immigration detention facility in
Musina. They were handcuffed and forced to roll in urine while being assaulted with hosepipes and kicked.
They were charged with malicious damage to property when they sought redress.
The ICD reported that between April 2007 and
March 2008, it received 20 complaints of torture and739  complaints of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In the same 12-month period it received 302 new reports of deaths in custody and490  suspects fatally shot by police during investigations, an 87 per cent increase over the previous year. Continuing weaknesses in resources and legal powers of the ICD were highlighted in parliament. An NGO study showed that police implemented only half of their recommendations. 
In April the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned two convictions and sentences for theft against
Bongani Mthembu on the grounds that they were based on evidence extracted under torture from a witness.
In July the government made public a revised
Combating of Torture Bill, following widespread criticism of the previous version in 2006, and concern expressed by a parliamentary committee in June at the government’s lack of political will to implement treaty obligations. The new version, however, still had serious weaknesses, including a failure to make clear the absolute prohibition against torture.
========== SPAIN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were widespread allegations of widespread torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials. In April the Constitutional Court reiterated the need for thorough and effective investigations into all such allegations. The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism expressed concern that allegations of torture and other ill- treatment continued and did not systematically result in prompt and thorough independent investigations.
Some political and legal authorities continued to argue that allegations of ill-treatment by detainees held on terrorism charges were part of a strategy to discredit the state. 
The judicial investigation continued into the death of
Osamuyia Akpitaye, a Nigerian national who died in2007  when being forcibly expelled from Spain. The investigating judge had charged the police officers involved with a “misdemeanour”. However, following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor and the victim’s family, the investigating court was ordered to lay a more serious charge against the police officers. At the end of the year the case was still under investigation. 
The investigation into allegations of ill-treatment of detainees at Les Corts autonomous Catalan police station in Barcelona continued to progress slowly. In one incident, concealed camera footage from March2007  showed police officers beating, kicking and insulting a detained man. Five officers were suspended from duty following the opening of a criminal inquiry, but on 16 January they returned to active duty while awaiting the outcome of the investigations. In June the
Public Prosecutor formally presented charges against the officers of falsifying police documents and minor assault. The Prosecutor requested a sentence of four and a half years’ imprisonment for the charge of falsifying documents and 15 months’ imprisonment and a fine for degrading treatment and assault. At the end of the year the trial date had still not been set. 
Almost three years after Mohammed Fahsi was allegedly tortured while being held incommunicado in
January 2006, no criminal investigation into the allegations had been opened. Both the General Council of the Judiciary and the Madrid Public Prosecutor were asked to investigate; both replied that there were no grounds to do so. 
On 5 January, two suspected members of ETA were detained and held incommunicado by Civil Guards in
Mondragón (Guipuzcoa). Both were reportedly ill-301Amnesty

treated during arrest, with one subsequently admitted to
San Sebastián hospital with two broken ribs and a punctured lung. An investigation into allegations of ill- treatment was opened immediately by Investigating
Court No.1 of San Sebastián but had not concluded by the end of the year.
Refoulement 
On 22 July Basel Ghalyoun was forcibly returned to
Syria, despite concerns that he would be at risk of torture and arbitrary detention. On 17 July the Supreme Court had acquitted him of involvement in the 11 March 2004 bomb attack on commuter trains in Madrid, and he was released from prison. Upon his release he was immediately taken into police custody under an expulsion order, as his residence permit had expired while he was in prison. Neither he nor his lawyer had been aware of the expulsion order, and his lawyer was unable to submit an appeal against it before Basel
Ghalyoun was expelled. He was arrested on arrival in
Syria and held incommunicado at an undisclosed location. 
On 31 December Murad Gasayev, a Russian citizen of Chechen origin, was extradited to Russia despite evidence that he would be at risk of an unfair trial and torture or other ill-treatment. The National Criminal Court approved the extradition request on the basis of“diplomatic  assurances” from the Russian Public
Prosecutor’s office that the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture (CPT) would be allowed to visit
Murad Gasayev in detention. The CPT informed the
Spanish authorities that it would not accept this responsibility due to serious concerns over the reliability of such “diplomatic assurances”. Despite this, the
Spanish authorities extradited Murad Gasayev under the condition that the Spanish embassy in Moscow would be able to visit him.

Jaber Tabbabi was detained on 5 June in connection with the Gafsa protests. Police tore off his clothes and struck him repeatedly while dragging him to a police station in Redeyef, where he alleges he was tortured.
He was moved to a police station in Metlaoui, where he was blindfolded, placed in a contorted position and had a stick inserted into his rectum. A cut to his head required 16 stitches. He alleged that he was kept naked until he was taken before an investigating judge in the
Gafsa Court of First Instance. The judge rejected his lawyer’s request that he be medically examined for evidence of torture, but ordered his immediate release.
He was released without charge on 9 June.
========== TURKEY ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports of torture and other ill-treatment rose during2008,  especially outside official places of detention but also in police stations and prisons. People accused of ordinary as well as politically motivated offences were vulnerable to ill-treatment. Counter- charges were often brought against individuals who said they had been ill-treated by law enforcement officials. 
In October, Engin Çeber died in hospital after being detained in İstinye police station and Metris prison in
Istanbul. An autopsy found that death was due to cerebral bleeding as a result of blunt trauma injuries consistent with those caused by blows to the head.
Nineteen law enforcement officials were suspended from duty and an indictment was drawn up against 60 state officials, some facing torture charges. In the first such statement of its kind, the Justice Minister apologized to Engin Çeber’s family and acknowledged that the death may have been due to torture.

Reports of torture and other ill-treatment committed by the police and other state security services, including in alleged secret detention centres, persisted. The Uganda Human Rights Commission’s10th  annual report recorded that people held in detention facilities were still tortured to the extent of sustaining serious wounds. There were no prosecutions of alleged perpetrators of torture and336

complaints of torture and ill-treatment; of these complaints 136 concerned ill-treatment by police and 49 by prison staff. 
Sergei Ushakov, his wife Anna and his mother-in- law were detained by police in Frunzenskiy district in
Kharkiv on 27 June in connection with the murder of
Anatoliy Logvinenko on the night of 26/27 June.
Sergei and Anna Ushakov were detained without access to a lawyer or any formal record of their detention. Anna Ushakova stated that she was threatened and beaten and forced to sign a statement implicating her husband in the murder. Sergei
Ushakov also said he was beaten and forced to sign a confession. His lawyer observed that he had wounds on his wrists which did not seem consistent with the normal use of handcuffs. Anna Ushakov was released on 28 June, and Sergei Ushakov was released by the prosecutor on 1 July because of the absence of any proof linking him to the murder. Both complained about the ill-treatment on 1 July. However, while they were giving their testimony in the Deputy Prosecutor’s office a group of policemen came into the office and forcibly took them back to the Frunzenskiy district police station. The couple described how they were again forced to sign false testimonies. Anna Ushakov was released the same day and Sergei Ushakov the following day. While they were in the police station both were concealed from the Prosecutor and at one point Sergei Ushakov was forced to leave the building through a window and was driven around Kharkiv for several hours to conceal his whereabouts. Sergei
Ushakov was charged with murder on 4 July and was remanded in custody on 21 July. The case was continuing at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Attempts continued to deport individuals alleged to pose a threat to national security to countries where they would be at real risk of grave human rights violations, including torture or other ill-treatment. The government continued to argue that “diplomatic assurances” – unenforceable promises from the countries to which these individuals were to be returned – were sufficient to reduce the risk they would face.
In April, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales ruled that the UK could not proceed with deportation in two cases involving diplomatic assurances.
In the case of two Libyan nationals, referred to as“A.S.”  and “D.D.”, the Court of Appeal upheld the342 
04 
A-Z09:A-Z copy 1 26/03/2009 14:16 Page 342
judgment of the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission (SIAC), the tribunal which hears appeals against deportation on national security grounds, that the assurances obtained from the Libyan authorities were not sufficient to protect them from a real risk of torture or other ill-treatment.
In the case of Omar Othman (also known as Abu
Qatada), a Jordanian national, the Court of Appeal found that the trial which he would face in Jordan – a trial in which SIAC said there was a high probability that evidence which may have been obtained by torture or inhuman or degrading treatment would be used against him – would amount to a flagrant violation of the right to a fair trial, and that the assurances given to the UK by Jordan would be no protection against this.
Following these decisions the Home Secretary announced that the government had “decided to discontinue deportation action in [the cases of D.D. and A.S.], and in the cases of 10 other Libyan nationals”. At least five of those Libyan nationals were later made subject to control orders.
In October, the Law Lords heard an appeal by the government against the Court of Appeal’s decision regarding Abu Qatada. At the same time they heard appeals by two Algerian nationals, referred to as“B.B.”  and “U.”, against an earlier decision of the
Court of Appeal which had upheld SIAC’s conclusions that they could safely be returned to Algeria on the strength of assurances obtained from the Algerian authorities.
The Law Lords were asked to consider the reliability of diplomatic assurances and the fairness of SIAC’s reliance on secret material.
By the end of the year, no judgment had been given in these appeals. The men facing deportation with assurances remained either in detention or subject to extremely strict bail conditions.

In February, the Foreign Secretary announced that he had been informed by the USA that, contrary to repeated assurances, the USA had used the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia on at least two occasions in 2002 for the purposes of transferring detainees in its programme of rendition and secret detention. The Foreign Secretary did not name the detainees involved. 
Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian national formerly resident in the UK, remained in US custody at
Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. In May, the Foreign Secretary told Parliament that “[UK] officials continue to discuss his case with the US”, but that the USA was “not currently inclined to agree to our request for [his] release and return”.
In October, a High Court hearing confirmed that an agent of the UK Security Service (MI5) had questioned Binyam Mohamed while he was detained in Pakistan in May 2002. The UK intelligence agencies had supplied information to the US authorities for use in the interrogation of Binyam
Mohamed, in the knowledge that he was detained incommunicado and had been denied access to a lawyer. UK intelligence agents had continued to supply information for use in his interrogation even when it became clear that he was no longer detained in Pakistan but was in a third country, where US agents continued to have direct access to him.
The High Court found that in principle, the government should have disclosed to Binyam
Mohamed’s lawyers information in its possession which could support his claim to have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, on the grounds that“the  relationship of the [UK] Government to the [US] authorities in connection with [Binyam Mohamed] was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing”.
In October, the Home Secretary asked the Attorney
General to investigate possible “criminal wrongdoing” by agents of the UK and USA in the treatment of
Binyam Mohamed.
Guantánamo Bay 
In March, a Spanish judge ruled that the physical and mental health of Jamil El Banna and Omar
Deghayes, two UK residents returned to the UK from
Guantánamo Bay in 2007, had been so severely damaged by their treatment during their years of detention that it would have been “impossible, even inhuman” to proceed with their extradition to stand trial in Spain.
By the end of the year, no decision had been made as to whether these two men, or a third man returned from Guantánamo at the same time, Abdennour
Sameur, would have restored to them the indefinite leave to remain in the UK which they had enjoyed prior to their detention and transfer to Guantánamo.
Armed forces in Iraq 
In March the Secretary of State for Defence admitted that “a substantive breach of Articles 2, right to life, and343Amnesty

3, prohibition of torture, of the European Convention on
Human Rights” had taken place in the case of Baha
Mousa, and that breaches of Article 3 had taken place in the treatment of a number of other individuals detained alongside him.
Baha Mousa died at a UK-run detention facility in
Iraq in September 2003, having been tortured and ill- treated by UK troops over a period of 36 hours. A number of Iraqis detained alongside him were also tortured and ill-treated.
In May a public inquiry was announced into the case of Baha Mousa under the Inquiries Act 2005, legislation which has been criticized for failing to ensure that inquiries are fully independent. The terms of reference of the inquiry require it to “investigate and report on the circumstances surrounding the death of Baha Mousa and the treatment of those detained with him, [...], in particular where responsibility lay for approving the practice of conditioning detainees”.
The inquiry opened in October.
Police and security forces 
In December, the coroner’s inquest ended into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian man shot dead by police officers in London in 2005. The jury was unable, on the evidence it had heard, to conclude that the police officers who shot Jean Charles de
Menezes had done so lawfully. The jury found that a number of failures in the police operation had caused or contributed to his death. The coroner had directed the jury that it could not return a verdict of unlawful killing. He did not consider that there was enough evidence for jury members to be sure beyond reasonable doubt that individual police officers had committed a criminal offence of murder or manslaughter.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were reports of ill-treatment by police and prison officers on the US mainland, often involving cruel use of restraints, or electro-shock weapons.
In October, former police officer John Burge was arrested and charged with perjury in a civil case in which he had denied knowledge of the abuse and torture of suspects. John Burge had been in charge of the Area 2 police station in Chicago where scores of black suspects had allegedly been tortured in the1970s  and 1980s. Although indisputable evidence of torture came to light through a subsequent inquiry, no officer had been prosecuted and John Burge was the first person to be charged indirectly in connection with the abuse.
Thousands of prisoners continued to be confined in long-term isolation in high security units where conditions sometimes amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Réne González and Gerardo Hernández, two
Cuban nationals serving prison sentences in the USA, continued to be refused visits with their wives who were denied temporary visas to enter the USA.
Electro-shock weapons
Fifty-nine people died after being shocked with
Tasers, bringing to 346 the number of such deaths since 2001. Although these deaths were commonly attributed to factors such as drug intoxication, medical examiners concluded that Taser shocks caused or contributed to at least 50 deaths.
Many of those who died were subjected to multiple or prolonged shocks, were under the influence of drugs and/or had health or other problems which could have made them more susceptible to the adverse effects of such devices. Tasers were also frequently used against people who did not pose a serious threat. Amnesty International called on the US authorities to suspend the use of Conducted Energy
Devices (CEDs) pending further studies or limit their use to situations where officers would otherwise be justified in using deadly force. 
Seventeen-year-old Darryl Turner died in March when he was shocked after an argument in the store where he worked in North Carolina. A video-tape showed a police officer firing Taser darts into Darryl
Turner’s chest as the unarmed teenager stood with his arms by his side. The officer held the trigger down for 37 seconds and shocked him again after he had collapsed on the floor. Darryl Turner died at the scene. The coroner ruled the cause of death to be a fatal disturbance of the heart rhythm due to stress and the Taser shocks. The officer received a five-day suspension from duty.
In June the Justice Department published an interim report of its study of deaths following the use of CEDs such as Tasers. The report stated that, while there was no “conclusive medical evidence” of a high risk of direct adverse effects from such devices,“[m]any  aspects of the safety of CED technology are not well-known”. It noted that the risk of death or injury could be higher in certain populations, including children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart problems.347Amnesty

Torture and other ill-treatment
Persistent allegations of widespread torture or other ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners continued.
These reports stemmed not just from people suspected of membership of banned Islamic groups or of having committed terrorist offences but also from other groups, including human rights activists, journalists and former – often high-profile – members of the government and security forces. The failure by the relevant authorities to properly investigate such allegations remained a serious concern. In January, judicial supervision of arrest was introduced, transferring the power to sanction arrest from the prosecutor’s office to the courts. These court procedures did not conform to fair trial standards and failed to give detainees the right to challenge their arrest or complain of any torture or other ill-treatment. 
In August the daughter of imprisoned poet and regime critic Yusuf Dzhuma claimed that her father was routinely tortured and ill-treated in Yaslik prison camp.
He said he was being singled out for beatings and ill- treatment because he was considered an enemy of the
President by prison staff, and that he had been locked up in quarantined cells with prisoners suffering from tuberculosis.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Police brutality and torture of detainees held in connection with politically motivated acts or protests as well as ordinary criminal suspects were reported to be widespread and carried out with impunity.
Confessions allegedly obtained under torture or other duress were accepted as evidence by the courts without being investigated adequately, if at all.
Reported methods of torture included beating with sticks, punching, kicking, prolonged suspension by the wrists or ankles, burning with cigarettes, being stripped naked, denial of food and prompt access to medical help, and threats of sexual abuse. 
Tawfiq al-Masouri, sentenced to death by the SCC in January for a murder committed when he was 17, was reportedly tortured while held incommunicado for three months by police in Sana’a. He said that he confessed as a result of torture, and a medical examination carried out at his lawyer’s request found marks consistent with these allegations. However, no further investigation was known to have been undertaken by the authorities.358

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of opposition supporters were widespread following the 29 March elections in Mashonaland, Midlands, Manicaland and
Masvingo provinces. In most districts, war veterans, soldiers and local ZANU-PF leaders established makeshift torture camps. The camps were set up in tents, clearings within a community, classrooms or at the homes of ZANU-PF officials or displaced MDC activists.
Local people were forced to attend all-night meetings at these camps. They were made to watch their neighbours being beaten and warned that if they did not vote for ZANU-PF on 27 June they would face a similar fate. MDC supporters were forced to denounce the party and surrender all their party materials, including t-shirts and membership cards.
Dozens of MDC supporters died after beatings at these camps. Local youths were forced to attend the camp meetings and participate in beatings. 
Kingswell Muteta, a police officer, was fatally beaten by ZANU-PF supporters in Mudzi district on 17 July after visiting the family of his brother-in-law, a local
MDC chairperson reportedly beaten to death by ZANU-
PF supporters. Witnesses said that Kingswell Muteta confronted a group of ZANU-PF youths who were under the instruction of a senior police officer. The
ZANU-PF youths took Kingswell Muteta to a camp near
Kotwa and accused him of having gone to an“enemy’s”  home. He was beaten by about 20 youths.
He sustained mainly soft tissue injuries on his buttocks, trunk and lower limbs. He was taken to hospital on 18
July and died of his injuries on 25 July.
