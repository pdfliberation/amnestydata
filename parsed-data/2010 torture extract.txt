Torture and other ill-treatment
Police and prison guards allegedly tortured or otherwise ill-treated detainees. In January the
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s report on its visit to Albania in June 2008 stated that“ill-treatment  by the police… often appears to be related to an overemphasis on confessions during criminal investigations”. The Committee had received allegations of serious ill-treatment in police stations in
Korça, Pogradec and Elbasan, and at Korça remand centre. The authorities subsequently said that disciplinary measures had been taken against several officials at Korça remand centre. 
In April Edison Lleshi, aged 15, threw himself out of a window of the police station in Peshkopi, breaking a leg and sustaining other injuries. The Ombudsperson concluded that he did this after being beaten and threatened by police officers who had questioned him about a theft. Disciplinary measures were taken against seven police officers, and a criminal investigation was started against one of them.

Torture victim Bakary J., a Gambian citizen, had still not received compensation or any form of68 
rehabilitation. He had been tortured by three police officers in Vienna in 2006 and was still at risk of deportation for residing illegally in the country. On20 
November, the Disciplinary Appeal Commission decided to dismiss from office two police officers involved in the case. A third officer, now retired, lost all pension benefits relating to his public employment.
========== AZERBAIJAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In November the UN Committee against Torture expressed concern at Azerbaijan’s failure to implement the Convention against Torture in legislation and practice, including by prosecuting those responsible for torture. The Committee was also concerned at the extradition of Chechens to the Russian Federation and of Kurds to Turkey, where they risked torture. 
In January the Supreme Court overturned the decision on the convictions of Dmitri Pavlov, Maksim
Genashilkin and Ruslan Bessonov made by the Baku
Appeal Court in July 2008. The convictions of the three juveniles in June 2007, on charges of murdering another teenager, had been based on confessions allegedly extracted under torture. The Supreme Court found that the Appeal Court had failed to summon witnesses, cross-examine them about contradicting testimonies, or investigate allegations of forced confessions. In June the Appeal Court reviewed the case for the third time but reportedly failed to rectify the errors identified by the Supreme Court.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In the majority of cases the authorities failed to take measures to tackle ill-treatment by the police and in prisons. The existing complaint mechanism was ineffective and the number of investigations by prosecutors into allegations of ill-treatment remained very low.
The State Ombudsmen issued a report in
September which stated that the conditions of detention across BiH were below international standards. They cited inadequate hygiene and material conditions as well as lack of access to health services for detainees. The authorities failed to address the situation in the Zenica Prison Forensic
Psychiatric Annex, where patients with mental health problems lacked adequate medical assistance.
Individuals convicted in the State Court continued to serve their sentences in prisons in FBiH and RS, as there was no BiH state prison. This caused discrepancies in their rights and material conditions while in detention.

Torture and prison conditions
Detainees continued to be held in cruel, inhuman or degrading conditions. Torture was regularly used as a method of interrogation, punishment, control, humiliation and extortion. Overcrowding remained a serious problem. Gang control of detention centres resulted in high levels of violence between prisoners.
Lack of independent oversight and high levels of corruption contributed to perpetuating entrenched problems of violence in the prison system, as well as in the juvenile detention system. Mechanisms for the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture had still not been put in place by the end of the year.
Some of the harshest conditions of detention continued to be reported from Espírito Santo state.
There were reports of torture, as well as of extreme overcrowding and the use of shipping containers(known  as “microwaves”) as cells. There were reports of prisoners dismembering other prisoners. Following extensive pressure from local human rights groups and official state and national monitoring bodies, some building projects were initiated. In March, an illegal ban on monitoring visits to the prison system was finally lifted.
In December, after evidence of torture and attempted homicide in the Urso Branco prison in the state of Rondônia, the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights issued a new resolution – its seventh since 2002 – calling on the Brazilian government to ensure the safety of the prisoners held there.85Amnesty

A decision on the Attorney-General’s call for federal intervention in October 2008 was still pending before the Supreme Court at the end of 2009.
========== BULGARIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Bulgaria was found to be in violation of the prohibition of torture or degrading treatment under the European
Convention on Human Rights. 
In January the European Court of Human Rights found that there had been a violation of the prohibition of torture and a lack of effective investigation into injuries, demonstrating that Georgi Dimitrov had been ill-treated in police custody. Arrested in 2001 on charges of fraud, he alleged after his release from prison in 2004 that he had been beaten by police officers.
In March the CERD expressed concern about ill-treatment and excessive use of force by the police against minority groups, particularly Roma. The
Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and the European
Roma Rights Centre submitted a shadow report to
CERD in which they cited cases of police ill-treatment of individuals or use of disproportionate force by the police against Romani communities. 
In August the Military Court of Appeals upheld the16  to 18-year sentences imposed on five “anti-mafia” police officers convicted in 2008 of beating to death38-year-old 
Angel Dimitrov in the city of Blagoevgrad.
The police officers appealed against their sentences to the Supreme Court of Cassation.
Mental health institutions
NGOs continued to be critical of the admission procedures and living conditions in social care institutions for people with mental illnesses. 
The European Court of Human Rights in November heard two cases regarding placements and living conditions in care homes in the towns of Pastra and88 
Pravda respectively. In both cases, it was claimed that individuals had been deprived of legal capacity and forcibly placed under guardianship. The European
Committee for the Prevention of Torture had recommended closure of the Pastra institution in 2003 because deficiencies in its living conditions and care amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, and the government had indicated its agreement with the recommendation in 2004.

Torture and other ill-treatment and deaths in custody
Torture continued to be commonplace in places of detention, sometimes leading to death. Torture methods used on detainees included beatings, often with an electric prod, hanging by the limbs, force feeding, injecting unknown drugs and sleep deprivation.
In March, the death of a 24-year-old in a detention centre in Yunnan province triggered a heated online debate about police and “jail bullies” torturing and otherwise ill-treating inmates. The online debate led to revelations of other cases of deaths in detention and prompted an investigation by the Supreme People’s
Procuratorate (SPP). In July, the SPP published a report investigating 12 of the 15 deaths that occurred in detention during the first four months of the year.
Of these, seven were found to have been beaten to death, three to have committed suicide, and two had died of accidental causes.

In March the National Defender of Rights(Ombudsperson)  reported that some psychiatric institutions continued to use restraint beds even where there was no risk to the patients or their environment. Restraint beds were in some cases included in the inventory of institutions. In September, the Ministry of Health issued a methodological guide to regulate the use of restraint techniques, including net-beds. In 2004 the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture had recommended the immediate withdrawal from service of cage-beds and the removal as soon as possible of net-beds as means for managing patients or residents in a state of agitation.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment remained common in military, police and intelligence service custody.
Armed groups were also responsible for such abuses.
Conditions in all detention centres and prisons constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Scores of prisoners and pre-trial detainees died from starvation and treatable illnesses. Rape and other sexual abuse of female prisoners were widespread.
There were frequent mass escapes from prisons and detention centres, including by army personnel accused or convicted of human rights violations. 
Twenty women detainees were raped at Goma’s
Muzenze prison during an attempted mass escape in
June. The women were attacked in their cells by a group of military prisoners armed with weapons smuggled into the prison.
========== DENMARK ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Although amendments to the Civil and Military
Criminal Codes had introduced torture as an aggravating circumstance for various criminal offences in 2008, and the Danish Criminal Code contains provisions punishing acts that amount to torture, Danish criminal law continued to omit torture as a specific crime in its own right.
The UN Special Rapporteur on torture expressed concern at, among other things, the extensive use of solitary confinement, particularly of pre-trial detainees.
Minors held on remand were regularly detained in the same facilities as adult inmates.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees were systematic in police stations, prisons and SSI detention centres and, for the most part, committed with impunity. In some cases, police were reported to have threatened victims against lodging complaints.
In rare cases, however, alleged torturers were prosecuted. 
In November, an Alexandria court sentenced a police officer to five years in prison for torturing Rajai
Sultan in July 2008 by beating him until he suffered a brain haemorrhage, for which he required surgery. 
Mona Said Thabet and her husband, Yasser Naguib
Mahran, were harassed and intimidated by police after she submitted a complaint to the Interior Ministry that her husband had been tortured by police at Shobra al-
Khayma before his release in September 2008 because he had refused to become an informer. She reported that police slapped and beat her, stubbed out a cigarette on her face, forcibly shaved her head and threatened to rape her unless she withdraw the complaint. Instead, she filed a further complaint with the Public Prosecutor in Shobra al-Khayma, who ordered an investigation. This led local police to make new threats against her, her husband and their children. She complained to the Public Prosecutor in
February, but no action was known to have been taken.
In May, families from Shobra al-Khayma demonstrated in Cairo against abuses allegedly committed by the head of the SSI in Shobra al-Khayma police station and to seek the intervention of the Interior Ministry.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture continued to be used in police stations. No investigations were carried out and perpetrators were not brought to justice.
Most of the 10 members of the People’s Union arrested in February and March were tortured in Bata and Malabo police stations. Santiago Asumo told the investigating magistrate that on one occasion he was placed on the floor on his stomach, his feet tightly bound with cables, and offered money to “confess”.
On another occasion, the police put paper in his mouth, put him in a sack which was then tied, and suspended and beat him. Although he named those who tortured him, there was no investigation and no one was brought to justice. 
Epifanio Pascual Nguema was arrested without a warrant on 26 February and taken to Bata police station. At about midnight on 2 March, police officers took him from his cell to the cellar and tortured him for four hours. They beat him around the kidneys, belly and genitals. For several days he passed blood in his urine and was unable to walk or stand up straight. He needed hospital treatment. He had been arrested apparently for procuring travel documents for his wife and for criticizing President Obiang. He was released uncharged in late May.
========== ERITREA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The authorities interrogated, tortured and otherwise ill-treated critics of the government in an attempt to deter dissenting opinion. Prisoners were often whipped, kicked or tied with ropes in painful positions for prolonged periods.
Prison conditions were dire. Many prisoners were held in underground cells or shipping containers and denied access to daylight. Conditions were overcrowded, damp and unhygienic.
Prisoners were frequently exposed to the sun for extended periods of time, or locked in metal shipping containers, which magnified extremes of heat and cold.
Religious prisoners reportedly died in custody as a result of harsh conditions and ill-treatment, or from lack of medical care for treatable diseases. 
Two Christians, Mogos Hagos Kiflom and Mehari
Gebreneguse Asegedom, reportedly died in detention in January. 
Yemane Kahasay Andom, aged 43, of the Kale-Hiwot
Church, reportedly died on 29 July due to torture. He had been held in an underground cell in isolation and was believed to have refused to sign a document renouncing his religion.

The special guard responsible for the shooting of
Alexis Gregoropoulos in December 2008 was charged with manslaughter with intent. The second guard was charged with complicity. Their trial was pending at the end of the year.
Incidents of excessive use of force by police during demonstrations were reported during the year. There were reports of a large number of arbitrary transfers of protesters to police stations, ill-treatment by police against some peaceful demonstrators and of police motorbikes injuring some demonstrators during the protests in December.
Reports continued throughout the year of ill- treatment by law enforcement officials, especially against members of vulnerable groups such as asylum-seekers, migrants and Roma. 
On 3 April, Arivan Osman Aziz, a Kurdish Iraqi migrant, was reportedly severely beaten by a coastguard officer in the port of Igoumenitsa. He died as a result of his injuries four months later. An investigation had not been concluded by the end of the year. 
In May, a police officer allegedly destroyed the
Koran of a Syrian migrant during an identity check.
The sworn administrative inquiry into the incident had not been concluded by the end of the year.
The Muslim migrant community staged several demonstrations to protest about the incident. 
In October, Mohamed Kamran Atif, a Pakistani migrant, died 14 days after he was reportedly subjected to torture during his arrest and detention in a police station in Piraeus. A criminal investigation was opened. 
In October, several asylum-seekers and migrants were reportedly beaten by police guards. The incident followed their request to be let out of a smoke-filled dormitory after a protest about detention conditions and length of detention in Pagani immigration detention centre in Lesvos. Among them was a 17- year-old Palestinian who reportedly was severely beaten. An investigation was opened and some witnesses reported being intimidated. 
The trial of a police officer charged with torturing two detainees with electric shocks in August 2002 commenced in December.
In December, the government presented a Draft
Presidential Decree establishing a Bureau to deal with incidents of arbitrary behaviour by law enforcement officials. Concerns existed over the institutional independence and limited mandate of the proposed body.

Torture and other ill-treatment, including rape, sustained beatings and stabbings, were routinely committed by the security forces. Detainees were also held incommunicado at secret locations. 
Soldiers arrested in January (see below) were beaten upon their arrival in the military barracks on Kassa
Island. They were undressed and were forced to lie down with their hands tied behind their back, and then trampled and beaten. 
People arrested after the September stadium massacre were tortured in secret detention. People searching for the bodies of their relatives or friends were arrested and beaten in military camps.
========== GUINEA-BISSAU ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Most of those arrested in March and June were tortured in military custody, including the five soldiers detained in connection with the killing of General

Human Rights League (LGDH). In addition, people who criticized the armed forces were tortured or otherwise ill-treated in custody. No investigations were carried out into these incidents and those responsible were not brought to justice. 
Pedro Infanda, a lawyer, was arbitrarily arrested by soldiers on 23 March, hours after holding a press conference during which he stated that one of his clients believed that the acting Chief of Staff of the
Armed Forces was not competent for the job. Pedro
Infanda was taken to the Amura military barracks in
Bissau and tortured for the first four days of his detention. He was beaten with a wooden stick and other objects, and sustained serious injuries to his back159Amnesty 
International Report 2010
for which he required intensive care treatment in hospital. 
At 1am on 1 April, four soldiers went to the home of
Francisco José Fadul, President of the Audit Court, and beat him with the butts of their guns, causing cuts to his head and one arm. He required intensive care treatment in hospital. His wife was also beaten, but was not seriously injured. Two days before the attack,
Francisco José Fadul had publicly criticized the behaviour of the armed forces and called on the government to hold the military accountable for corruption and for the killings of President Vieira and
General Tagme na Waie.

He was released without charge four days later and admitted to hospital. The day before, 26 October, Deonaradine Rafik had also been badly beaten and forced to sign a confession. He was charged with murder on 30 October and held in pre- trial detention until charges were withdrawn and he was released on 3 December. Nouravie Wilfred was held incommunicado for seven days and ill-treated before being released without charge on 3 December.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In November the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the case of Kaboulov v. Ukraine that the extradition to Kazakhstan of any criminal suspect, including Amir Damirovich Kaboulov, would be in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, as they would run a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.
Despite amendments to the criminal and criminal procedural codes to clamp down on abusive practices, torture and other ill-treatment remained widespread. Confessions reportedly extracted under torture continued to be admitted as evidence in criminal trials, and individuals continued to be held in unregistered detention for longer than the three hours allowed for in national law. The lack of a clear definition of detention remained unaddressed despite recommendations of the UN Committee against
Torture in November 2008.
Following his visit to Kazakhstan in May 2009, the
UN Special Rapporteur on torture concluded that he“received  many credible allegations of beatings with hands and fists, plastic bottles filled with sand and police truncheons and of kicking, asphyxiation through plastic bags and gas masks used to obtain confessions from suspects. In several cases, these allegations were supported by forensic medical evidence.” 
In June, Dmitri Tian and Oleg Evloev were sentenced to 25 years’ and life imprisonment respectively by a193Amnesty 
International Report 2010
court in the capital Astana for the premeditated murders of a woman and her three children. Both men claimed that they had not committed the murders, but that they had been tortured in detention in order to force them to confess. According to observers of the trial, the judge instructed the jury not to consider the allegations of torture. Reportedly, a video tape recorded by the police following Oleg Evloev’s arrest, showed him covered in bruises, but it was lost by the prosecution.
In November, the Supreme Court turned down the appeals by both defendants. No investigations into the allegations of torture were conducted.
Prison conditions 
Inessa Karkhu, an accountant serving an eight-year prison sentence for fraud handed down in 2007, continued to be denied essential medical treatment for glaucoma, a disease that progressively damages vision.
Her condition continued to deteriorate throughout the year and it was feared that she could end up losing her sight if she was not treated as a matter of urgency. She had to rely on medication delivered by her family which became difficult when she was transferred to a prison in Almaty, some 1,000km from the capital Astana.
Following international pressure, Inessa Karkhu was examined by an independent ophthalmologist in
November, who found that the disease had significantly progressed and that both her eyes were affected.
Nevertheless, Inessa Karkhu had not received the recommended medical treatment by December.

The Committee criticized the authorities for not fully investigating such allegations in an impartial and independent process. The Committee further reported high levels of violence between prisoners, which the authorities failed to prevent or limit. This resulted in self-harmings by inmates seeking transfer to safer prison units.

In February Macedonia ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture; the Ombudsman’s

Both police and NGOs reported a decline in torture and other ill-treatment. This followed the disbanding of the special “Alfi” police units outside Skopje; improvements in investigations by the Ministry of
Interior Sector for Internal Control and Professional
Standards (SICPS); and the introduction of custody records at police stations. However, judges and prosecutors failed to initiate investigations into allegations of ill-treatment, even when detainees brought before the court showed signs of ill-treatment.
In March, following an investigation into the alleged beating of Jovica Janevski at Tetovo Police Station in2008,  the SICPS referred the case to the Tetovo
Public Prosecutor, who had previously failed to open an investigation into the allegations.
The Ministry of Justice initiated a Strategic Plan to address “deplorable” prison conditions reported by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture in 2008, including the urgent refurbishment of several prisons, facilities for prisoners, and the strengthening and training of prison staff.
In June, the European Court of Human Rights made a preliminary consideration of an application made by Jasmina Sulja, the partner of Sabri Asani, an ethnic Albanian who died after allegedly being beaten while in police custody in January 2000. No effective investigation had been carried out, denying Jasmina

An 18-year-old woman received 100 lashes on 5 July after being accused of having sex with two men outside marriage. Local journalists reported the woman fainted after being flogged and was taken to hospital for treatment. The woman, who was pregnant at the time of sentencing, had her punishment deferred until after the birth of her child. The court ruled the woman’s pregnancy was proof of her guilt.

Despite the release of 68 detainees in September from Dar Naïm, prisons remained overcrowded.
Harsh and arbitrary punishments continued to be reported. In Nouadhibou and Dar Naïm prisons, detainees were crammed together in stifling heat.
Only old and sick detainees were occasionally allowed to leave their cells. Detainees went on hunger strike to protest against food shortages. Families of detainees staged a sit-in to protest against torture of prisoners suspected of terrorism.

Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights reported that during his visit to detention centres following the events in April, the majority of people interviewed by his delegation alleged ill-treatment by police officers. 
Oxana Radu was among a group of 36 young people who had come from Cahul in the south of the country in two minibuses to witness the events. They were stopped as they were leaving Chişinău after midnight on 8 April, and then escorted to the General
Police Commissariat. Oxana Radu, her sister and one other woman were taken directly into the police station. She told Amnesty International that she was led into a room where there was a female and a male police officer. She was forced to strip naked. The male police officer said: “You’re cold, we will warm you up.”
She stated that she was forced to perform squats while naked and was threatened and sworn at as she did so. She was then taken to a cell with four other women and her younger sister. They were reportedly left for two days without food or water, access to a lawyer or the possibility of contacting their families.
Oxana Radu was accused of having shouted at a policeman and sentenced to five days’ administrative detention by a judge in the police station. She and two other women were taken to the police station in
Drochia in the north of the country to serve their sentences. She was released at 2 am on 14 April.

Prison authorities claimed that he had committed suicide but his relatives reportedly noted bruises consistent with torture on his forehead, arms and legs. Three prison officials were suspended for negligence, but no criminal charges were brought against them. 
More than 250 bodies of suspected militants were reportedly found in Swat after mid-July, some hanging from poles, warning the Taleban of the same fate.

Torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances
Torture continued to be practised in military facilities and secret detention centres. In May, the UN
Committee Against Torture expressed concern about the “numerous, ongoing, credible and constant allegations… of routine and widespread use of torture and ill-treatment of suspects in police custody, especially to extract confessions” and that those“committed  by law enforcement and military services personnel were seldom investigated or prosecuted”. 
In January, the military abducted Mansur Salih, a tricycle driver from Maguindanao province, during a raid on his village. The military held him incommunicado in a secret detention centre where he was beaten and repeatedly given electric shocks. He was fed only once every three days. Mansur Salih was made to sign a document he had not read, before he surfaced in April and was charged with arson. 
In May, the military reportedly abducted Melissa
Roxas, an American citizen of Philippine descent, in
Tarlac province. The military beat her and subjected her to near-suffocation with plastic bags. Melissa Roxas said that she was mistakenly identified by her abductors as the former secretary-general of leftist labour group Migrante.
In November, the Anti-torture Bill became law.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Criminal investigations into allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued in 2009. 
On 22 May the Criminal Court of Faro issued its sentence in the case of the torture of Leonor Cipriano.
The court recognized that she had been tortured in police custody in 2004, but acquitted all three police officers, claiming that it was impossible to identify exactly who had been responsible. A fourth officer was convicted of giving false testimony and another was convicted of falsifying documents. Leonor Cipriano’s appeal was pending at the end of the year. 
By the end of the year, no trial date had been set for three judicial police officers accused of torturing
Virgolino Borges in March 2000. The case was due to go to trial in November 2008 but was delayed pending further medical examinations requested by the defence. Virgolino Borges said that he had been tortured by police officers who punched him and beat him on the soles of his feet with a wooden post while in custody. The investigation had been closed in 2005 by the public prosecutor, who stated that Virgolino Borges’ injuries could have been self-inflicted. Virgolino Borges appealed against this decision to the Lisbon region courts: first to the Tribunal de Instrução and then to the
Tribunal da Relação, which in November 2005 ordered that the case go to trial.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Regional commissions for public oversight of places of detention started to function from January onwards.
They were appointed in several Russian regions271Amnesty 
International Report 2010
following the adoption of enabling legislation in
September 2008. There were widespread reports of torture or other ill-treatment in places of detention, including alleged denial of medical aid. In a few cases, law enforcement officials were convicted of abuse of office in connection with such reports.
However, allegations that the authorities failed to investigate effectively such abuses remained frequent. 
In February and April, Zubair Zubairaev, an ethnic
Chechen, was reportedly beaten and otherwise ill- treated by prison officers in a prison colony in
Volgograd region. During a visit in April his lawyer saw marks on his shoulders and across his chest. No medical help was provided and the injuries he received were not recorded. Possibly as a result of his complaints about his treatment, Zubair Zubairaev was transferred to a different colony. 
Sergei Magnitskii, a lawyer, died in pre-trial detention in Moscow in November. A criminal investigation into his death was opened following information that he had been denied medical treatment.
========== RWANDA ==========
========== SAUDI ARABIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were common and committed with impunity. Methods used included severe beatings, electric shocks, suspension, sleep deprivation and insults. 
Dr Saud al-Hashimi, a prisoner of conscience held in solitary confinement since his arrest in February 2007, was reported to have been tortured and otherwise ill- treated several days after he began a hunger strike in
June to protest against his continuing detention.
He was said to have been stripped to his underwear, shackled and dragged to an extremely cold cell, where he was held for five hours.
========== SENEGAL ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Several cases of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees in police stations were documented.
Confessions extracted under torture were used to convict people after unfair trials. 
In January, more than 20 students and young people detained after riots in the gold-mining town of
Kédougou, about 700km south-east of Dakar, were reportedly tortured in order to extract confessions and incriminate others. Some of the detainees were given electric shocks. Others were beaten, kicked and punched while naked. Although several detainees told the court during their trial that they had been tortured, the judges and the prosecutor did not order an inquiry into the allegations. Nineteen defendants were sentenced to prison terms on the basis of their“confessions”. 
They were pardoned in March by
President Wade.
========== SERBIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In January the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture reported on its November 2007 visit to places of detention in Serbia. There were fewer allegations than on previous visits but ill-treatment, including disproportionate force on arrest, continued.
The UN Committee against Torture (CAT) in July found that Besim Osmani was in June 2000 subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment during the forced eviction of a settlement in Belgrade. The CAT noted that the“infliction  of physical and mental suffering [was] aggravated by… his Roma ethnic origin… a minority historically subjected to discrimination and prejudice.”
The authorities had failed to open an investigation, denying Besim Osmani the rights to have his case promptly and impartially investigated and to receive compensation.
Torture and other ill-treatment
In January the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture reported on its March 2007 visit to places of detention in Kosovo then under UNMIK’s control. It reported the denial of detention rights and ill-treatment by Kosovo Police Service officers, and criticized conditions in most psychiatric and social welfare institutions. The Committee also described ill- treatment in several prisons by the elite Intervention
Unit, including the beating of juvenile males at
Lipjan/Lipljan Correctional Centre.282 
========== SIERRA LEONE ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
Caning remained a form of punishment for a number of offences under Singapore law, including immigration offences. At least five individuals were sentenced to caning, mostly for sexual offences such as rape.
Military service remained compulsory, and under military regulations conscientious objectors and others who failed to comply could be caned and imprisoned for offences such as non-compliance with lawful orders and insubordination.
========== SLOVAKIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were some positive developments in legal cases regarding police officers accused of torture, and at least one further report of ill-treatment by officers was received. 
In September, the Supreme Court confirmed the sentences of six former police officers who were convicted of ill-treatment and the unlawful death of
Karol Sendrei, a 51-year-old Romani man who died in police custody in 2001. The two officers principally responsible were sentenced to eight and a half years’ imprisonment. 
Seven police officers were accused of ill-treating six
Romani boys in Košice police station in April, after a newspaper published graphic video footage of the abuse. In May, the General Prosecutor informed
Amnesty International that racial motivation would be considered.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Incidents of torture and other ill-treatment by police of detained crime suspects were reported. Corroborated cases included the use of suffocation and electric shock torture. Incidents of torture rose, according to the police oversight body, the Independent
Complaints Directorate (ICD). From April 2008 to
March 2009 they investigated 828 incidents of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, some of which amounted to torture. Suspects in several cases were interrogated and assaulted while held without any record of their arrest. Despite continuing efforts by the South African Human Rights
Commission and civil society organizations, South
Africa did not ratify the Optional Protocol to the
Convention against Torture.
The Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons received over2,000  complaints of assaults against prisoners by prison warders between April 2008 and March 2009.
In October, a provision in the new Correctional
Services Amendment Act, which compels prison officials to report any use of force to the Inspecting
Judge immediately, became operational.
Overcrowding remained a serious problem, with19  prisons “critically overcrowded”. 
Sidwel Mkwambi died in February while in the custody of the Bellville South Organized Crime Unit(OCU). 
Police claimed he had jumped out of a moving police vehicle, but his injuries were not consistent with their claims. In May, the provincial minister for police295Amnesty 
International Report 2010
ordered them to co-operate with the ICD-led investigation. The ICD referred the case to the prosecuting authorities for a decision on charges against 14 members of the OCU.

Torture and other ill-treatment/police and security forces
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued. Following the introduction in 2008 of comprehensive CCTV systems in Catalan autonomous police stations, a national
NGO network reported that complaints of ill-treatment against Catalan police officers had gone down by almost 40 per cent compared to 2007. None of the complaints they recorded related to ill-treatment occurring inside a police station. However, the national police and Civil Guard had still not implemented these measures, except with detainees held incommunicado, and only then when specifically requested by a judge.
The Public Prosecutor’s annual report stated that there had been more than 230 complaints of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials during the year. No steps had been taken to create an independent police complaints commission, despite repeated recommendations by international human rights bodies, including the UN Human Rights
Committee. 
No date was set for the trial of the two police officers charged with killing Osamuyia Akpitaye while he was being forcibly deported from Spain in June 2007. 
In June a video was published on the internet showing the degrading treatment of a Senegalese man during an attempt to forcibly deport him from Spain.
The footage showed him lying on his stomach on the tarmac at Madrid airport, his arms and legs tied together behind his back and apparently being gagged by plain-clothes police officers. The officers then picked him up off the ground, still tied up, and put him into the back of a police van after the pilot refused to allow him to board in these conditions. 
In June, three police officers accused of ill-treating a detainee at Les Corts autonomous Catalan police station in Barcelona in March 2007 were convicted of assault and sentenced to a €600 fine. A fourth officer was acquitted. Concealed camera footage showed the officers kicking and beating the detainee.298

Torture and excessive use of force
Police and other security officials, including informal policing groups, continued to use excessive force against criminal suspects, political activists and unarmed demonstrators. Incidents of torture and other ill-treatment were also reported. The problem of impunity for such abuses remained unaddressed.
Although the new Commissioner of Police, Isaac
Magagula, stressed the need to respond to the public’s concern about crime without resorting to“police  brutality” and limited police use of lethal force to circumstances where the lives of police or others were at risk, victims of police abuses continued to have no access to an independent complaints investigation body. 
On 16 April church and labour union organizers had to call off a march for free education after violence erupted. A breakaway group damaged property and assaulted a police officer. The security forces used disproportionate force against some demonstrators, including a man whom they beat with batons, kicked, strangled and stamped on apparently because he had insulted the national flag. 
On 4 September, Wandile Dludlu, president of
SWAYOCO, the Swaziland Youth Congress, was unlawfully arrested by four police officers near the border with South Africa. He was taken to a forested area near Bhunya and interrogated about weapons309Amnesty 
International Report 2010
while being subjected to repeated suffocation torture, with his hands and ankles tied tightly behind him.
About seven hours later the police dumped him, uncharged, in Mbabane. He needed hospital treatment for injuries and psychological trauma consistent with his allegations. He lodged a criminal complaint against named police officers at Mbabane police station, but by the end of the year the investigation had not resulted in any arrests. He also lodged a civil claim for damages. 
On 21 September, Correctional Services security officers, without issuing a warning to disperse, assaulted political activists who had gathered peacefully to wait for the release of Mario Masuku (see above) from Matsapha Central Correctional facility.
The security officers also demanded that journalists stop filming and photographing their actions. They seized cameras and other reporting equipment and verbally abused, threatened and physically assaulted several journalists. The police investigation into the incident had not resulted in any arrests by the end of the year. In addition, no publicly known steps were taken by the authorities against the Department of
Correctional Services, despite public calls for an inquiry into the violence and the intimidation of media workers.
========== SWEDEN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The HRC expressed concern about the failure to guarantee the right of detained criminal suspects to access a doctor; the reported number of self- inflicted deaths in prisons; and the absence of an effective and independent police complaints body.
In December, the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture stated that the authorities had taken insufficient measures to allay its concerns regarding legal safeguards against ill-treatment in police custody; the imposition of restrictions on remand prisoners; and the isolation of certain categories of sentenced prisoners. 
An investigation into the death of Johan Liljeqvist, a24-year-old  man who had died in April 2008 following his arrest by the police in Gothenburg, was reopened in
October amid reports that police investigators had attempted to cover up the extent of the injuries he had sustained.
In December, the Parliamentary Ombudsman criticized the use of pepper spray by the police in certain circumstances. These included in vehicles and on police premises against individuals whom the police already had under control; where there was no threat of violence; or as an inducement to follow police orders.
Sweden failed to introduce torture as a crime in its penal code.
========== SWITZERLAND ==========
========== SYRIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were reported to be common in police stations, security agencies’ detention centres, and prisons. These abuses were committed with impunity. The SSSC and other courts continued to convict defendants on the basis of“confessions”  that the defendants alleged were extracted under torture while they were held incommunicado in pre-trial detention.
Seven suspicious deaths in custody were reported but the authorities apparently took no action to investigate them or the allegations of torture made by detainees. 
Jakarkhon ‘Ali, a member of the Kurdish minority, was reported to have been tortured by beatings, electric shocks and being forced to stand for up to 20 hours each day while he was held incommunicado by Military
Security officials following his arrest on 20 June. He was released without charge on 3 October. 
Yusuf Jabouli and Mohammed Amin al-Shawa died in Military Security custody in January, the former after several days’ detention and the latter after he had been detained for more than four months. Their families were not permitted to examine the bodies and Military
Security officials attended the funerals. Unofficial sources alleged that both men had died as a result of torture. The authorities disclosed no information and were not known to have investigated the deaths.

Torture and ill-treatment
Reports of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued, in particular to extract confessions in police detention during the first 72 hours, the maximum period suspects could be held without charge. 
On 27 June, Khurshed Bobokalonov, a specialist at the Tajikistani Oncology Centre, died after being arrested by the police. He had been walking along the street when police stopped him and accused him of being drunk. He protested, and some 15 policemen bundled him into a police car. The Ministry of the
Interior claimed that he died of a heart attack on the way to the police station. His mother reported injuries on her son’s face and body, and on 22 July the Minister of the Interior announced an investigation into possible“death  through negligence”. There was no public information about the progress of the investigation by the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment in police stations and detention centres, including the Interior Ministry’s
Department of State Security, continued to be reported. Some detainees were held incommunicado beyond the limit allowed by law, with their arrest dates falsified by police to cover this up. Detainees were at particular risk of torture or other ill-treatment when they were being held incommunicado. The courts, however, routinely disregarded torture allegations made by defendants and convicted them on the basis of confessions allegedly obtained under torture. No official investigations into torture allegations were known to have been carried out after complaints were filed, and security forces continued to operate with impunity. 
Ramzi Romdhani, serving a prison sentence totalling29  years imposed in 2008 after he was convicted under the 2003 anti-terrorism law in nine separate cases, alleged that he had been tortured and otherwise ill- treated by guards at Mornaguia Prison in April. In
August, he was taken to the State Security Department where, he alleged, security officials tortured him with electric shocks, suspended him by the limbs, hanged him by the neck for a few seconds and threatened him with death. He said that in December he was again tortured for two days by State Security Department officers. He sustained serious eye injuries.
========== TURKEY ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be reported, with many abuses taking place away from official places of detention. Those accused of ordinary crimes, as well as people accused of politically motivated offences, were vulnerable to ill-treatment. 
In January the trial began in Istanbul of 60 state officials, including police officers and prison guards, on charges connected with the death in custody of Engin
Çeber in October 2008. Some of the accused faced charges of torture. The trial continued at the end of the year. 
In October Resul İlçin died from head injuries after being detained in the south-eastern province of Şırnak.
A statement from the governor’s office pre-empting the official investigation indicated that the death did not result from ill-treatment.
========== TURKMENISTAN ==========
========== UGANDA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The government failed to ensure that suspected perpetrators of torture and other ill-treatment by the police and other state security services were brought to justice. Victims and survivors were rarely granted access to justice and legal remedies. Up to 71 per333Amnesty 
International Report 2010
cent of the Uganda Human Rights Commission’s compensation awards since 2001 remained unpaid by the government. Most complaints submitted to the
Commission by victims of human rights violations related to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.
========== UKRAINE ==========
Torture and other Ill-treatment/impunity
There were continued reports of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials and of the authorities’ failure to carry out effective and independent investigations into such allegations.
Between January and October, 13 human rights NGOs belonging to the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights
Union received 165 complaints about torture and other ill-treatment, of which 100 related to police actions. Ukraine ratified the Optional Protocol to the
UN Convention against Torture in 2006, but had still not set up a national mechanism for monitoring places of detention in accordance with its obligations under the Protocol. 
On 24 March, Vadim Glavatyi was sentenced at Podil regional court to nine years’ imprisonment for rape and robbery. He appealed against the sentence and the appeal was pending at the end of the year. Since
September 2006, Vadim Glavatyi had reportedly been subjected to torture and other-ill-treatment on three occasions by police officers from Podil district police station to make him confess, first to robbery, and then to rape, resulting in injuries which required hospital treatment. In October, the Kyiv Prosecutor replied to a letter from Amnesty International stating that there were no grounds to start criminal proceedings against officers of Podil police station. The letter stated that other police officers from Podil police station were investigating the alleged ill-treatment by their colleagues.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Further reports emerged that grave human rights violations had been committed with the knowledge, complicity and, in some cases, in the presence of
UK intelligence officers, including in Bangladesh,
Egypt, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, and that UK officials had attempted to cover up the UK’s involvement. In August, two Parliamentary
Committees expressed concern about the UK’s involvement in the torture of “terror suspects” held abroad. However, calls for independent investigations into the UK’s role in these and other gross violations of human rights perpetrated in the context of the so- called war on terror, including into the UK’s involvement in the US-led rendition programme (the unlawful339Amnesty 
International Report 2010
transfers of terrorist suspects between countries), went unheeded. 
In February, Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian national formerly residing in the UK, was released from
US custody at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where he had been held since 2004, and returned to the UK. He had been detained in Pakistan in April 2002 and then transported under the US-led rendition programme to
Morocco, then to Afghanistan, and then on to
Guantánamo Bay. The US government did not dispute that his treatment amounted to torture or other ill- treatment. UK judges ruled repeatedly during the year that the UK government should disclose what the US
Central Intelligence Agency told the UK’s Security
Service (MI5) and what the UK’s Secret Intelligence
Service (MI6) knew of the unlawful treatment of
Binyam Mohamed. They also made clear that “the relationship of the United Kingdom Government to the
United States authorities in connection with [Binyam
Mohamed] was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing.” The UK government’s appeal against the disclosure rulings was pending at the end of the year. In March it was announced that the police would begin an investigation into the allegations of possible criminal wrongdoing. 
By the end of the year, Shaker Aamer, a Saudi
Arabian national, was the only known remaining former
UK resident still held in Guantánamo Bay. Following his capture in Afghanistan he had been detained by US military authorities in various locations and ultimately in
Guantánamo Bay. In December, the High Court of
England and Wales ordered the UK authorities to disclose certain documents to support his case that any confessions he might have made during his detention had been induced by ill-treatment by US and UK officials, thereby discrediting such confessions and improving his prospects of release. 
In February, the government admitted that, contrary to earlier statements, two individuals captured by UK forces in Iraq in 2004 and transferred to US detention had subsequently been moved to a US detention facility in Afghanistan. The US government categorized them as “unlawful enemy combatants”. There was concern that efforts to identify them were being hampered by the UK government.
In December, the UK All Party Parliamentary
Group on Extraordinary Rendition began legal proceedings in the USA, requesting disclosure from various US security agencies about the UK’s role in the US-led rendition programme. This included the unlawful transfer of two people through the UK territory of Diego Garcia, and the handover in Iraq by
UK special forces to US forces of other individuals who were then flown to Afghanistan.
Deportations
Attempts continued to deport individuals alleged to pose a threat to “national security” to countries where they would be at risk of grave human rights violations, including torture. The government continued to argue that “diplomatic assurances” were sufficient to reduce the risk they would face. 
In February, two Algerian nationals, referred to in legal proceedings in the UK as “RB” and “U”, and
Omar Othman (also known as Abu Qatada), a
Jordanian national, lost their appeals before the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (the Law
Lords) against deportation to their respective countries on “national security” grounds. In all three cases the government was relying on “diplomatic assurances”, given by the Algerian and Jordanian governments respectively, claiming that they would sufficiently reduce the risk that the men would be subjected to grave human rights violations, including torture, on their return.
The following day, the European Court of Human
Rights issued interim measures indicating to the government that Omar Othman should not be deported to Jordan. At the end of the year, his case was pending. 
In April, 10 Pakistani students in the UK were arrested and detained under suspicion of involvement in terrorism. They were later released without charge but immediately rearrested and detained again, pending deportation on “national security” grounds.
They were held in high security prisons. By December, eight of them had abandoned their appeals against deportation and had returned to Pakistan.
In December, the High Court of England and Wales ruled against the government and the Special
Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). It held that, even in the context of bail proceedings before the
SIAC, a fair hearing required sufficient disclosure, and that exclusive reliance on secret material would breach fair trial standards.
Internment
In February, the Grand Chamber of the European
Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that, by340 
interning nine foreign nationals on suspicion of terrorism, the UK had violated their right to liberty.
Detaining them without charge or trial had discriminated unjustifiably between them and UK nationals. The Court also found that four of the nine had not been able to effectively challenge the allegations against them because the open material on which the government had relied consisted purely of general assertions and the national court’s decision to maintain their detention was based solely or to a decisive degree on secret material to which neither they nor their lawyers of choice had had access. The
Court also held that each of the nine had been denied the right to compensation for the above violations.“Control  orders”
As of 10 December there were 12 “control orders” in force under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.
The Act gives a government minister unprecedented powers to issue “control orders” to restrict the liberty, movement and activities of people purportedly suspected of involvement in terrorism, on the basis of secret intelligence. 
In June, the Law Lords applied the judgement of the
European Court of Human Rights (see above) and allowed the appeals of three individuals, referred to as“AF”, “AN”  and “AE”, against the imposition of “control orders”, finding that it had breached their right to a fair hearing. The Law Lords ruled unanimously that sufficient disclosure must be given to “AF”, “AN” and“AE”. 
The judgement ruled that people subjected to“control  orders” had to be given sufficient information about the allegations against them to enable them to mount an effective defence, and that, where the case against the “controlee” was based solely or to a decisive degree on closed materials, fair trial standards would not be met. 
In August, Mahmoud Abu Rideh, a stateless
Palestinian who was originally interned in December2001  under powers enacted in the aftermath of the
September 2001 attacks in the USA and then made subject to a “control order” since March 2005, said that he could no longer stay in the UK and wished to leave.
Following the threat of legal proceedings, the government agreed to provide him with a certificate of travel that permitted him to leave and re-enter the UK for up to five years. Nonetheless, almost as soon as
Mahmoud Abu Rideh had left the country, the government cancelled his certificate of travel, and ordered his permanent exclusion from the UK.

Torture and other ill-treatment – electro-shock weapons
At least 47 people died after being struck by police
Tasers, bringing to more than 390 the number of such deaths since 2001. Among them were three unarmed teenagers involved in minor incidents and an apparently healthy man who was shocked for 49 continuous seconds by police in Fort Worth, Texas, in
May. These and other cases raised further concern about the safety and appropriate use of such weapons. 
Fifteen-year-old Brett Elder died in Bay City,
Michigan, in March, after being shocked by officers responding to reports of unruly behaviour at a party.
The coroner ruled that the boy, who was of small stature, died from alcohol-induced excited delirium, with the Taser shocks a contributory factor.
========== URUGUAY ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued reports of widespread torture or other ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners, and the authorities failed in most cases to conduct prompt and impartial investigations into torture allegations.
Several thousand people convicted of involvement with Islamic movements and Islamist parties banned in Uzbekistan continued to serve long prison terms under conditions that amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In January an appeals court in Tashkent upheld the prison sentences of up to 17 years of four police officers convicted in December 2008 of torture. The officers had been convicted of killing 30-year-old Muzaffar
Tuichev in the town of Angren in March 2008. Relatives said he had been detained to extort money from him, and that up to 15 police officers had beaten and tortured him for several hours. 
Poet and government critic Yusuf Dzhuma, sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in April 2008 for allegedly resisting arrest and causing bodily harm, was said in November to be emaciated, ill and barely able to walk. He was reportedly held in punishment cells for periods of up to 11 days, and on one occasion handcuffed, hung by his hands from the ceiling and repeatedly beaten. He told his family that, during a visit to Yaslik prison camp by delegates of the ICRC, he had been transferred to a prison in Nukus, denied food and drink, refused access to a toilet and held naked in very cold conditions. 
In November the independent human rights organization Ezgulik reported that two sisters arrested in Tashkent in May on charges of hooliganism and robbery were repeatedly raped in custody by police officers. Their family said the charges were fabricated.
They were subsequently sentenced to six and seven years in prison. One of the sisters reportedly became pregnant as a result of the rapes and tried to kill herself.
In December the General Prosecutor’s office said it would investigate.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment of detainees by police and prison guards.
The most commonly cited methods were beatings on the body with sticks and rifle butts, kicking and punching, and suspension by the wrists and ankles.
The purpose appeared to be to punish and to extract“confessions”  from detainees that could be used against them in court. 
Tens of detainees held in connection with protests in the south were reported to have been beaten and subjected to tear gas at al-Mukalla Central Prison in
August after chanting demands in support of the independence of the south and for demanding their release. Seven who were seen as ringleaders, including
Salim ‘Ali Bashawayh, were suspended by their wrists and ankles for several hours, causing them severe pain.
They had been arrested in May after a peaceful protest calling for the release of political prisoners. 
Tawfiq Bassam Abu Thabit died in October while detained at the Political Security Prison in Sana’a. He had been wounded by shrapnel during armed clashes in Sa’da in 2008 and detained at a military checkpoint when his family were trying to take him for medical treatment. The authorities gave no reason for his death, which was possibly the result of medical neglect or ill- treatment. No investigation was known to have been conducted.
In November, Yemen’s application of the UN
Convention against Torture was considered by the
Committee Against Torture; the Committee urged the government to take immediate measures to eradicate torture.
========== ZIMBABWE ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees persisted.
No perpetrators were brought to justice. 
In September the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe ruled among other things that Jestina Mukoko (see above) had been tortured by state security agents who abducted and held her incommunicado in December2008. 
Despite this, no investigation was carried out. 
At least 95 soldiers were arrested in October in
Harare on suspicion of breaking into an armoury at
Pomona barracks and stealing 21 guns. They were reportedly tortured while being interrogated by members of the Central Intelligence Organization,
Military Intelligence Corps and Military Police. At least two of them died as a result of the injuries sustained.
One was reported to have committed suicide while in solitary confinement. Pascal Gwezere, a transport manager for the MDC-T who was charged with the same offence, was detained by state security agents from his home in Harare on 27 October and tortured.
He was denied access to medical treatment. He was released on 24 December on bail after the Supreme
Court upheld an earlier bail ruling by the High Court.
Manfred Nowak, the UN Special Rapporteur, was barred from entering Zimbabwe on 28 October. The government withdrew the invitation two days earlier on the grounds that an SADC delegation was in the country assessing the performance of the unity government.
