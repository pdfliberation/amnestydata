Commissioners of the Ombudsperson’s Office visited
Tirana police stations and detention centres following the January demonstrations. They stated that detained demonstrators, two of whom bore marks of physical ill-treatment, alleged being ill-treated during arrest, and that psychological pressure had been used to make them sign self-incriminating statements.
Nine complaints of police ill-treatment were reportedly filed. In February, the Internal Control Service of the
State Police undertook to investigate complaints, but by the end of the year no perpetrators had been brought to justice. 
The Ombudsperson wrote to the Prosecutor General raising the case of Reis Haxhiraj, who was allegedly severely ill-treated during his arrest in March. The
Ombudsperson stated that although his injuries were58 
clearly visible, and he had complained of ill-treatment when brought before a judge to be remanded in custody, neither the police, prosecutor, judge or hospital staff had reported his ill-treatment or initiated an investigation. His requests to contact the
Ombudsperson’s Office were ignored. The Prosecutor
General subsequently instructed prosecutors and officers of the judicial police to collect evidence on the ill-treatment of detainees, in order to bring those responsible to justice, and an investigation was started into the alleged ill-treatment of Reis Haxhiraj.

In February, mobile phone images of the torture in 2010 of two prisoners by prison guards in San
Felipe prison, Mendoza province, came to light.
Prisoners Matías Tello and Andrés Yacante, who were suspected by prison officers of involvement in circulating the images, received threats and were transferred to Almafuerte prison where they alleged that they were tortured. By the end of the year nobody had been brought to justice.
========== ARMENIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment remained a concern.
In a report published in February, the UN Working
Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that many of the detainees and prisoners they interviewed had been subjected to ill-treatment and beatings in police stations. Police and investigators used ill-treatment to obtain confessions, and prosecutors and judges frequently refused to admit evidence of ill-treatment during court proceedings.
In August, the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture reported that it had received a significant number of credible allegations of ill- treatment, some amounting to torture, by police during initial interviews.
Steps were taken during the year to establish a
National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) – an independent body to monitor places of detention – in line with Armenia’s obligations under the Optional
Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. A
Torture Prevention Expert Council was set up within the Human Rights Defender’s Office to act as the NPM, and the composition and guidelines for the NPM were discussed with NGOs and experts and approved.
Recruitment for the NPM began in October. 
On 9 August, seven young opposition activists detained following a clash with police alleged that they were beaten and ill-treated while in police custody. The activists were reportedly beaten up and detained after they tried to intervene as police officers were searching another man. The activists circulated internet images described as being taken by themselves on their mobile phones, showing some of them with visible injuries on their faces and backs. All seven were charged with hooliganism and assault on state officials, but six were later released on bail. There had been no investigation into the allegations of police ill-treatment by the end of the year.

Austria failed to introduce the crime of torture into its criminal code despite repeated recommendations by the UN Committee against Torture. 
Gambian citizen Bakary J., who was tortured by four police officers in 2006 following an unsuccessful deportation, had still not received reparation and was at risk of deportation. His complaint before the European
Court of Human Rights was still pending. 
In January, the police officer who in February 2009 injured US citizen Mike B., an African-American teacher, during a plain-clothes police operation in
Vienna, was sentenced to a fine for grievous bodily harm by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court. In68 
September, the fine was reduced by the Austrian
Supreme Court.
========== AZERBAIJAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Several activists detained at and after the protests in

Bakhtiyar Hajiyev alleged that he had been ill-treated and threatened with rape while in police custody in
March, but his allegations were dismissed without effective investigation. 
Tural Abbasli, leader of the youth wing of the opposition Musavat Party, maintained that he had been beaten when arrested on 2 April and again while in custody in Yasamal district police station in Baku. 
Tazakhan Miralamli, of the opposition Popular
Front Party, was allegedly beaten with batons by the police while being taken into custody on 2 April. His left eye was badly injured. He maintained that he was beaten again in the Sabail district police department before being taken to hospital, where, in addition to the injury to his eye, he was diagnosed with a broken finger, kidney problems and extensive soft tissue damage.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Many of the people detained in March and April were taken to police stations and to the Criminal
Investigations Department in Manama, where they were held incommunicado and interrogated by members of the National Security Agency and other security forces. Many alleged that they were beaten, made to stand for long periods, given electric shocks, deprived of sleep and threatened with rape. Many said they were held incommunicado for weeks after their interrogation ended.
The authorities failed to conduct independent investigations into most of these allegations. The
NSC also failed to adequately investigate defendants’ allegations of torture in pre-trial detention and accepted contested “confessions” as evidence of guilt. However, in November, shortly before the BICI presented its report and in anticipation of its findings, the government said it would amend the Penal Code to criminalize torture and that 20 members of the security forces were on trial in connection with allegations of torture of detainees, deaths in custody as a result of mistreatment, and unlawful killings of civilians. Full details of these prosecutions had not been disclosed by the end of the year. 
Aayat Alqormozi, a student who had read out poems during the February protests, was arrested when she presented herself to the authorities on 30 March after masked members of the security forces twice raided her parents’ house and threatened to kill her brothers if she did not surrender. She was held incommunicado for the first 15 days, during which she said that she was punched and kicked, given electric shocks to the face, forced to stand for hours, verbally abused and threatened with rape. On 12 June, the NSC sentenced her to one year in prison after convicting her of participating in illegal protests, disrupting public security and inciting hatred towards the regime. She was conditionally released on 13 July after she pledged not to participate in protests or criticize the government.
Her case was referred to the High Criminal Court of
Appeal, which ruled on 21 November that the case was suspended but without clarifying her legal status. She was at liberty at the end of the year, but was prevented from resuming her studies at Bahrain University.
========== BANGLADESH ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
At least three people died in police custody, allegedly after being tortured. The government announced that criminal charges would be brought against any police personnel found responsible for these deaths.
However, no one was charged or prosecuted by the end of the year. The government did not commit to bringing to justice police, RAB or other security personnel who allegedly tortured thousands of individuals in their custody throughout the year. 
Newspaper editor Mahmudur Rahman told Amnesty
International after his release in March that he was beaten severely on his back over the course of a night at a police station inside the army cantonment. He was detained in mid-2010 after publishing articles exposing alleged government corruption. The beating was so severe that he lost consciousness for several hours. He said he saw no point in complaining as he knew the authorities would not bother to act.
========== BELARUS ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There was no independent system of monitoring places of detention. Complaints against law enforcement officers were usually rejected by prosecutors, and those who complained faced reprisals from police. 
On 28 February, after being released on bail,
Alyaksei Mihalevich, a presidential candidate charged with organizing a demonstration in Minsk on 19
December 2010, held a press conference. He alleged that he and other detainees had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including being strip- searched up to six times a day, and being forced to stand in stress positions. 
Zmitser Dashkevich, who was sentenced to two years’ hard labour on 24 March in connection with the demonstration in December 2010, was placed in solitary confinement eight times during the year.
Conditions in solitary confinement include being denied exercise, refused bedding and deprived of sleep. Prisoners are also prevented from lying or sitting on bunks during the day.
========== BELGIUM ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
On at least two occasions the authorities attempted to rely on diplomatic assurances to remove foreign nationals to countries where they could be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. 
A.A., a Dagestani national in detention since
September 2010, faced extradition to the Russian
Federation on charges of participating in the activities of illegal armed groups. The charges against him were based on testimony allegedly obtained through torture, which was later retracted by the witness. The Belgian courts rejected A.A.’s appeals against extradition, based in part on diplomatic assurances that he would not be tortured in the Russian Federation. The Minister of Justice’s decision on the extradition was pending at the end of the year. 
In March, the Minister of Justice decided to allow the extradition of Arbi Zarmaev, an ethnic Chechen, to the Russian Federation, despite the Court of Appeal advising against it. The Court suggested that there was a lack of adequate guarantees that Arbi Zarmaev’s human rights would be respected in Russia. The
Minister of Justice’s decision was in part based on diplomatic assurances from the Russian authorities that he would not be tortured. At the end of the year his appeal against that decision was pending before the
Council of State.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were committed by armed groups and government security forces, including the FARDC, the national police, the National
Intelligence Agency and the Republican Guard.
Security forces often committed torture and other ill-treatment in detention facilities following arbitrary arrests. NGOs and UN officials continued to be denied access to many facilities, and secret and unofficial holding cells were still in use.
In July, the DRC promulgated a law criminalizing torture. Implementing this legislation remained a key challenge as security services continued to commit torture and other ill-treatment, including in illegal detention facilities. 
Between 27 July and 1 August, during a military operation in Rutshuru territory, North Kivu, FARDC soldiers reportedly arbitrarily arrested 27 people as a reprisal for alleged FDLR collaboration. At least eight of them were allegedly subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and forced labour. 
On 13 April, in Vusamba, Lubero territory, North
Kivu, a PNC detainee was whipped 40 times before being freed because he could not pay the US$40 requested for his release.

Danish authorities for damages for transferring him to Iraqi police custody in Basra in 2004, despite allegedly knowing there was a risk that he would be subject to torture or other ill-treatment.
In December, further information emerged indicating that at least 500 Iraqi nationals may have been handed over to Iraqi authorities in similar circumstances. Concerns were also raised that information confirming that the Danish army was aware of the risk of torture that would be faced by those transferred to the Iraqi authorities was withheld from parliament.

Despite the dissolution of the SSI, whose officials had committed torture with impunity, there were continuing allegations of torture and other ill- treatment by the police and armed forces, and a number of detainees died in custody in suspicious circumstances. In June, the Public Prosecutor set up a committee of three judges to examine torture complaints. While some of the torture allegations against the police were investigated, none of those against the armed forces was adequately investigated or led to prosecution. 
Mostafa Gouda Abdel Aal was arrested in Cairo’s
Tahrir Square on 9 March by soldiers who beat and dragged him to the nearby Egyptian Museum. There, they blindfolded him, tied his hands behind his back and threw him to the floor, doused him with water and subjected him to electric shocks to his penis and buttocks, and beat him on his back with a cable. He was held for a night in a van with other detainees before being taken to Heikstep Military Prison where the detainees were beaten and mocked by military prosecution interrogators. Officials did not ask them about their injuries, which were visible, or why their clothes were bloodstained, and they were hit with electric shock batons before being tried before a military court held in the prison canteen. After grossly unfair trials, they were sentenced to between one and seven years in prison and transferred to Tora Prison.
They were released on 23 May following a pardon by the SCAF; Mostafa Gouda Abdel Aal still had visible injuries caused by torture.

Prison conditions were appalling, and in many cases amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Many detainees were held in underground cells or metal shipping containers, often in desert locations and therefore suffered extremes of heat and cold. Prisoners were given inadequate food and drinking water. Many prisoners were held in severely overcrowded and unhygienic conditions.
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees were frequent. Prisoners were forced to undertake painful and degrading activities, and were tied with ropes in painful positions for long periods.
========== ETHIOPIA ==========

There were regular reports of torture in detention.
A significant number of the 107 opposition members and journalists mentioned above complained of torture or other ill-treatment during interrogation in Maikelawi detention centre. Detainees reported beatings, including with pieces of wire, metal and furniture; suspension by the wrists; sleep deprivation; and being held in isolation and in complete darkness for prolonged periods. Many reported being forced to sign confessions and other documents that would be presented against them as evidence.145Amnesty

Arezki Kerfali’s trial for insulting a police officer (a charge he denied), was set for March 2011 but postponed until March 2012. Arezki Kerfali’s complaint of ill-treatment against the police officers who arrested and detained him and his friend Ali Ziri on 9 June 2009 was not investigated. Ali Ziri died the following morning(see  below), and Arezki Kerfali was declared unfit for work for eight days as a result of the injuries he sustained while in police custody. At the end of the year he continued to suffer from serious psychological trauma. 
Lamba Soukouna’s complaint of ill-treatment by police officers on 8 May 2008 was heard by an investigating judge in September. Lamba Soukouna, who suffers from sickle cell anaemia, a serious genetic illness, said he was severely beaten by police near his home in Villepinte, a suburb of Paris, and had to remain in hospital for three days following the incident. An investigation was still pending.
========== GAMBIA ==========

Investigations into allegations of ill-treatment were not always effective due to a lack of independent police complaints mechanisms in all federal states and to difficulties in the identification of police officers. In
July, the federal state of Berlin started implementing individual identification consisting of name or number tags for all its police officers. 
Investigations into excessive use of force during a demonstration in Stuttgart in September 2010 were ongoing. In March, the Stuttgart Local Court fined one police officer €6,000 for the use of pepper spray against a woman participating in a sit-in. The lawyer of four protesters who sustained severe eye damage from a water cannon blast requested that the chief public prosecutor be discharged from the case due to an alleged lack of impartiality. 
On 4 August, the Frankfurt Regional Court awarded moral damages to Markus Gäfgen for having been threatened by two police officers with the infliction of intolerable pain in 2002 as he was apprehended on suspicion of having kidnapped an 11-year-old boy. The court qualified the threat as “inhuman treatment” under the European Convention on Human Rights.

In December, the Mixed Jury Court of Athens found a former police officer guilty of torturing two young men on separate occasions with an electric shock device in
August 2002 at the Aspropyrgos police station. The
Court handed down a six-year prison sentence, suspended on appeal. 
In December, two police officers were found guilty of causing bodily harm under the torture provision of the
Criminal Code to two refugees in Aghios Panteleimon,
Athens in December 2004. The officers were also found guilty for causing unprovoked bodily harm to five other Afghans. One officer was sentenced to five years and five months imprisonment and the other, five years.
Both sentences were suspended on appeal. Concerns were expressed by NGOs that the Court had converted the original charge of torture in relation to the treatment of the two refugees to the lesser offence of violations against human dignity proscribed under the torture provision.
There was a large a number of allegations of ill-treatment by police during demonstrations.
In April, police withdrew from the town of Keratea where clashes between police and residents protesting against the creation of a landfill site had been ongoing since December 2010. There were reports of excessive use of tear gas and other chemicals by the police, and allegations of ill- treatment of town residents. The authorities also reported a large number of injuries to police officers.
There were mounting allegations of excessive use of force, including the use of chemicals, by police during the anti-austerity demonstrations that took place during the year. On several occasions, the otherwise peaceful demonstrations became violent when a minority of rioters clashed with police. Video footage, pictures, press reports and witness testimonies pointed to the repeated use of excessive force by police in the demonstrations in Athens on15, 28  and 29 June, including the extensive use of chemicals, against largely peaceful protesters. A criminal investigation was ordered by the Athens
Prosecutor’s Office into the allegations. 
On 11 May, riot police reportedly used excessive force and chemicals against a large number of peaceful protesters, in Panepistimiou Street in Athens. More than 30 protesters sought hospital treatment, mainly for head injuries, including two who were seriously injured and required further hospital treatment. A criminal investigation began into the case of Yiannis Kafkas, one of the protesters seriously injured. 
Manolis Kypraios, a journalist, suffered total loss of hearing after a riot police officer threw a stun grenade in front of him while he was covering the demonstration in Athens on 15 June. A criminal and disciplinary investigation began into his case. At the end of the year, the Athens Prosecutor’s Office filed charges against as yet unidentified police officers for intentionally causing the journalist serious bodily harm.

Security forces faced repeated allegations of torturing and otherwise ill-treating detainees, particularly peaceful political activists in areas with a history of independence movements such as Papua and
Maluku. Independent investigations into such allegations were rare. 
In January, three soldiers who had been filmed kicking and verbally abusing Papuans were sentenced by a military court to between eight and 10 months’ imprisonment for disobeying orders. A senior
Indonesian government official described the abuse as a “minor violation”. 
There were no investigations into allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of 21 peaceful political activists by Special Detachment-88 (Densus-88), a police counter-terrorism unit. The 21 had been tortured during arrest, detention and interrogation in Maluku in
August 2010.
Caning was increasingly used as a form of judicial punishment in Aceh. At least 72 people were caned for various offences, including drinking alcohol, being alone with someone of the opposite sex who was not a marriage partner or relative (khalwat), and for gambling.

========== IRAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment in pre-trial detention remained common and committed with impunity.
Detainees were beaten on the soles of the feet and the body, sometimes while suspended upside-down; burned with cigarettes and hot metal objects; subjected to mock execution; raped, including by other prisoners, and threatened with rape; confined in cramped spaces; and denied adequate light, food, water and medical treatment. Up to 12 people reportedly died in custody in suspicious circumstances, including where medical care may have been denied or delayed; their deaths were not independently investigated. At least 10 others died during unrest at Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj near
Tehran in March. No allegations of torture or ill- treatment were known to have been investigated by the authorities; those who complained of torture faced reprisals. Harsh prison conditions were exacerbated by severe overcrowding. 
At least four Ahwazi Arabs – Reza Maghamesi, Abdol
Karim Fahd Abiat, Ahmad Riassan Salami and Ejbareh
Tamimi – were reported to have died in custody in
Khuzestan province between March and May, possibly as a result of torture. 
Journalist Issa Saharkhiz; Zahra Jabbari; Azerbaijani minority rights advocate Sa’id Metinpour; and dissident cleric Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi were among many political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, with serious health problems who were denied adequate health care. Political activist Hoda

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were widespread in prisons and detention centres, in particular those controlled by the Ministries of Interior and Defence.
Commonly reported methods were suspension by the limbs for long periods, beatings with cables and hosepipes, electric shocks, breaking of limbs, partial asphyxiation with plastic bags, and rape or threats of rape. Torture was used to extract information from detainees and “confessions” that could be used as evidence against them in courts. 
Abdel Jabbar Shaloub Hammadi, who helped organize anti-government protests, was arrested on24 
February in a Baghdad street by 30 armed police.
He was beaten, blindfolded and taken to a police building in Baghdad’s al-Baladiyat district. During the first five days he was held there, he alleges that he was suspended by his wrists with his legs and arms bound together, and had icy water thrown over him. He was released without charge on 8 March.
Torture and other ill-treatment
A number of pro-democracy activists, including members of opposition political parties, were detained and tortured and otherwise ill-treated. 
Sharwan Azad Faqi ‘Abdullah, who was arrested in
Erbil during the protests on 25 February, was detained for four days and tortured. He was repeatedly punched to force him to sign a “confession”, and still had visible injuries apparently caused by torture when Amnesty
International delegates saw him on 11 March in Erbil. 
In early December, scores of members of the
Kurdistan Islamic Union, an authorized Islamist party, were arrested in Dohuk and Zakho by Kurdish security forces. Many were released within days, but at least 14 were held for several weeks. Some were reported to have been tortured. The arrests took place immediately after attacks by Islamist protesters on shops selling alcohol and other businesses.

Confessions allegedly obtained under duress were accepted as evidence in Israeli military courts. 
Islam Dar Ayyoub, aged 14, was arrested at his home in the West Bank village of al-Nabi Saleh at around 2am on 23 January. Blindfolded and handcuffed, he was transferred by military jeep via the nearby settlement of
Halamish to the police station in the settlement of
Ma’ale Adumim, where he was interrogated for hours without the presence of a lawyer; he was not allowed to rest, eat, or go to the toilet. Information obtained from him during interrogation was used to incriminate al-
Nabi Saleh protest organizer Bassem Tamimi (see below). 
In February, Gazan engineer Dirar Abu Sisi was forcibly transferred to Israel from Ukraine and held at
Shikma Prison, near Ashkelon, where he was denied188 
access to a lawyer for 25 days. In April, he was charged with developing rockets for Hamas’ military wing; the
Israeli authorities said he had confessed but his lawyers alleged that his confession had been obtained under torture. He was still held, reportedly in solitary confinement, at the end of the year.

Appeals against the second instance verdicts, issued by the Genoa Court of Appeal in the trials of law enforcement officials, medical personnel and prison officers for the ill-treatment of protesters at the 2001
Genoa G8 summit, were still pending before the Court of Cassation. 
In March, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that there was no violation of the right to life in relation to the death of protester Carlo Giuliani on the streets of Genoa on 20 July 2001. In May 2003, the inquiry into his fatal shooting by a law enforcement officer had ended with the judge of the preliminary investigation ruling that the officer had acted in self- defence and should not be charged.
Deaths in custody 
In June, the Bologna Court of Appeal confirmed the first instance guilty verdict against four police officers for the unlawful killing of 18-year-old Federico
Aldrovandi. Owing to the application of a law on pardon, the initial sentence of three years and six months was commuted to six months only. Federico Aldrovandi died in 2005 after being stopped by police officers in Ferrara. Appeals were filed before the Court of
Cassation. In May, one of three police officers who had been sentenced in 2010 to prison terms of eight, 10 and 12 months respectively for helping to throw the inquiry off track, was also given a suspended sentence of a further three months. In January, a fourth police officer was acquitted of charges of involvement in deflecting the investigations. 
In March, the trial against a prison guard for failing to assist Aldo Bianzino and other criminal offences, began. Aldo Bianzino died in prison in Perugia in 2007 two days after his arrest. Proceedings for homicide against unidentified perpetrators were closed in 2009. 
The trial in relation to the death of Stefano Cucchi was ongoing. Six doctors, three nurses and three prison officers stood accused of various criminal offences, including abuse of authority and abuse of office, bodily harm and failure to offer assistance. In January, a high- level official in the prison service was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for falsifying official documents and for abuse of office. Stefano Cucchi died in October2009  in a hospital’s prison wing in Rome several days after his arrest. 
Investigations were still ongoing into allegations of ill- treatment suffered by Giuseppe Uva while in police custody hours before his death. He died in June 2008 in a hospital in Varese. The trial against a doctor for his manslaughter, allegedly due to wrong medical treatment, was ongoing. In December, the body of
Giuseppe Uva was exhumed to undergo further forensic examination.

Torture and other ill-treatment
The government amended Article 8 of the Constitution to explicitly provide that detainees are not to be “tortured… or harmed physically or emotionally” and are only to be held in places “sanctioned by law”, and to invalidate “confessions” or other statements obtained under duress. Despite these important new safeguards, reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.
========== KAZAKHSTAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In July, the UN Human Rights Committee discussed
Kazakhstan’s report on implementing the ICCPR.
It regretted that Kazakhstan had not made more progress in eliminating torture and questioned the political will of the authorities to fulfil their commitments, especially in initiating effective investigations into allegations of torture or other ill- treatment. In the same month, in a retrograde move, the President signed a decree authorizing the transfer of the prison system back to the authority of the
Ministry of Internal Affairs, thereby defeating years of reform efforts by government and NGOs. Access by public monitors to prisons and pre-trial detention centres had greatly improved since their transfer to the authority of the Ministry of Justice in 2004. In contrast, access to police cells and other places of detention under the authority of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs remained problematic and most allegations of torture continued to be received from there. 
Nikolai Maier, aged 21, and four of his friends were reportedly attacked by 15 police officers while they were sitting in the courtyard of his apartment block in
Rudni on 25 July. Eyewitnesses stated that the police officers hit the young men with rubber batons and kicked them. Nikolai Maier lost consciousness. All five men were then detained at the police station. Nikolai
Maier was charged with endangering the life and health of law enforcement officers. The following morning,
Nikolai Maier was taken to hospital and diagnosed with concussion, and head, eye and thigh injuries. He was placed under house arrest. Despite medical evidence and numerous complaints from his family and their lawyer, the Prosecutor’s Office made no investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-treatment by the police. The Kostanai Regional Internal Affairs
Department found that the use of force by the police officers was justified. The trial started in November and no verdict had been reached at the end of December. 
Following the violence in Zhanaozen on16 
December, released detainees and relatives of detainees reported that scores of people, including young women, had been rounded up and kept incommunicado in overcrowded cells in police custody.
They claimed the detainees had been stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and doused with cold water. Journalists199Amnesty 
International Report 2012
reported hearing screams coming from interrogation rooms in police stations. However, without access, independent monitors found it difficult to verify the allegations. At least one man was alleged to have died as a result of the torture he was subjected to in police custody.

Men, women and children in the camps were tortured and ill-treated, including by being forced to work in dangerous conditions. The combination of hazardous forced labour, inadequate food, beatings, totally inadequate medical care and unhygienic living conditions, resulted in prisoners falling ill, and a large number died in custody or soon after release. The government continued to deny the existence of political prison camps.

Mohammad Ghazzai al-Maimuni al-Mutairi died after police arrested him in January for possessing alcohol. Initially, the authorities said he resisted arrest and died from a heart ailment but then launched an investigation after an opposition MP produced medical evidence indicating that he had been bound and severely beaten before he died. Some 19 police officers were charged in connection with his death; their trial was continuing.
The CAT urged the government to amend the law to make torture a crime punishable by severe penalties.
========== KYRGYZSTAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports of torture and other ill-treatment in the aftermath of the June violence continued throughout2011. 
The authorities acknowledged that torture and ill-treatment in detention was a problem.
In April, a new Prosecutor General was appointed.
She soon issued a directive requiring all reports and complaints of torture to be immediately investigated and all places of detention to be inspected regularly and without notice. In September, she issued detailed instructions on the methodology of investigating torture. Human rights organizations and the
Ombudsman’s Office co-operated with the OSCE in order to set up independent detention monitoring groups throughout the country with the right of unimpeded access to all detention facilities. The groups started operating in August.
The then President and the new Prosecutor
General made repeated efforts to stop the routine use of beatings and other ill-treatment in order to extract confessions. However, at regional and local levels there appeared little commitment to effectively address and prevent these serious human rights violations. The KIC concluded that “acts of torture were committed in detention centres by the209Amnesty 
International Report 2012
authorities of Kyrgyzstan in the aftermath of the June events... [S]uch acts of torture are ongoing and … the response of the authorities to allegations of torture has been grossly inadequate.”
There were serious concerns that while investigating crimes, police officers continued to disproportionately target Uzbeks and Uzbek neighbourhoods, threatening to lay charges of serious crimes, such as murder, in relation to the June violence in order to extort money from them. At least two ethnic Uzbeks died in police custody reportedly from torture. 
Usmonzhon Kholmirzaev, an ethnic Uzbek Russian citizen, died on 9 August, reportedly as a result of torture, two days after he was arbitrarily detained in
Bazar-Korgan by plain-clothes police officers and taken to the local police station. He told his wife a gas mask had been put over his face and he had been beaten.
When he collapsed, one of the officers reportedly kneed him in the chest two or three times until he lost consciousness. The police threatened that if he did not pay them US$6,000, they would charge him with violent crimes in relation to the June 2010 violence. He was eventually released after his family gave the officers
US$680. He was hospitalized the next morning and died of his injuries a day later. His wife said that he had told her that the officers were responsible for his injuries. His wife and her lawyer, who were present at his autopsy, reported that the forensic examination found that he had died of internal haemorrhaging.
Following an official request from the Russian consulate, the prosecutor of Jalal-Abad opened a criminal case in August against four police officers with several charges, including torture.
The government renewed its invitation to the
UN Special Rapporteur on torture and he visited the country in December. He concluded that the use of torture and ill-treatment was widespread for the purpose of extracting confessions. Torture methods included “being subjected to asphyxiation through plastic bags and gas masks, punched, beaten… and applied electric shocks… during arrest and first hours of informal interrogation.” Conditions of detention ranged from “adequate to dreadful”.
========== LAOS ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
Cases of torture and other ill-treatment by the judicial police were reported.
The government had still not established an independent monitoring body to visit prisons and detention centres, breaching a requirement of the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against
Torture, which Lebanon ratified in 2008. 
In April, four inmates of Roumieh Prison in Beirut died in unclear circumstances when security forces quelled a protest by detainees against overcrowding and prolonged pre-trial detention. The Interior Minister appointed the head of the ISF to conduct an inquiry, but its outcome was not made public.
========== LIBERIA ==========
========== LIBYA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Individuals arrested and detained by al-Gaddafi forces were tortured or ill-treated, particularly upon capture and during initial interrogations. Detainees were beaten with belts, whips, metal wires and rubber hoses; suspended in contorted positions for prolonged periods; and denied medical treatment, including for injuries sustained as a result of torture or shooting. Some were tortured with electric shocks.
Several were shot after being apprehended and while posing no threat. Some were left to suffocate in metal containers. 
On 6 June, guards ignored pleas for water and air by detainees held in two metal containers in al-Khums; 19 suffocated to death.
Several male detainees were raped by their captors or guards. 
A 50-year-old man was arrested by al-Gaddafi forces while receiving treatment at Tajoura Heart Hospital in Tripoli in late February. At Ain Zara Prison, also in
Tripoli, he was kicked, hit with sticks and rifle butts, given electric shocks and tied to a tree. While in custody, he was raped twice using implements.
Allegations of rape by al-Gaddafi forces were widely reported by NTC supporters, and some women detained by pro-NTC forces in al-Zawiya, Tripoli and
Misratah alleged they had been sexually abused. 
Eman al-Obeidi told international journalists on26 
March that she had been raped by soldiers loyal to
Colonel al-Gaddafi. After periods of being detained by al-Gaddafi forces, she was released and fled Libya in May.
She was forcibly returned from Qatar to Benghazi in June, but was later allowed to leave NTC-controlled territory.
In areas controlled by the NTC before as well as after August, when Tripoli fell to the forces opposing
Colonel al-Gaddafi, militias in control of detention centres tortured or ill-treated detainees with impunity, seemingly to punish them for alleged crimes or to extract “confessions”. The most commonly reported methods included beatings all over the body with belts, sticks, rifle butts and rubber hoses; punching; kicking; and death threats. Individuals with dark skin, whether Libyan or foreign nationals, were especially vulnerable to abuse. 
A 17-year-old migrant worker from Chad was taken from his home in August by armed men who handcuffed and slapped him and dragged him along the ground before detaining him at a school that they were using as a detention facility. There, he was219Amnesty 
International Report 2012
punched and beaten with sticks, belts, rifles and rubber cables, mostly on the head, face and back. The torture only stopped when he agreed to “confess” to killing civilians and raping women.
Several detainees died in the custody of militias in circumstances suggesting that torture contributed to or caused their death. 
Abdelhakim Milad Jum’a Qalhud, a school director from the town of al-Qarabuli, east of Tripoli, was detained at his home on 16 October by a local militia.
In the following days he was seen twice by doctors who noticed multiple bruises on his body and urged his hospitalization. However, the militia ignored the medical advice and on 25 October the body of
Abdelhakim Milad Jum’a Qalhud was delivered to the local hospital. The forensic report suggested that he had died as a result of beatings with an instrument. No effective investigation into the circumstances of his death was initiated.

Martin Neskovski was severely beaten on 6 June during post-election celebrations in Skopje, and died of head wounds. Despite initial denials, Igor Spasov, a member of the “Tigers” anti-terrorist police unit was detained on 8 June.

========== MEXICO ==========
Torture
Measures to prevent, investigate and punish torture remained ineffectual, and statements obtained under duress continued to be accepted in judicial proceedings. 
In February, a woman was arbitrarily detained in
Ensenada, Baja California state, and reportedly tortured by members of the army in a military barracks in Tijuana while being interrogated by a civilian federal prosecutor. She was subjected to assault, near asphyxiation, stress positions and threats to coerce her into signing a confession. She was held in pre-charge detention (arraigo) for 80 days before being charged and remanded in custody. The authorities initially235Amnesty 
International Report 2012
denied all knowledge of her detention. The prosecution case subsequently collapsed and she was released without charge. At the end of the year, there was no information on the investigation initiated into her torture complaint. 
In September, a federal court ordered a partial retrial of Israel Arzate Meléndez for his alleged involvement in the Villas de Salvárcar massacre of 15 young people in
Ciudad Juárez in 2010. The CNDH investigation had found that he had been tortured by the military to make a confession. However, the review court failed to rule that the defendant’s rights had been violated by the trial judge’s failure to order an investigation into the allegations of torture or to exclude the confession extracted under torture as evidence.
========== MOLDOVA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Conditions in pre-trial detention and during transfer between detention centres and the courts frequently amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
Vasilii Cristioglo was detained on 19 January in
Comrat, charged with burglary, and held from21 
January to the end of the year in pre-trial detention in Cahul. The cell had a toilet in full view of the other detainees, and no bedding was provided. Vasilii
Cristioglo was forced to pay for blood tests when he suspected that he may have contracted hepatitis.
During transfer to and from the court, Vasilii Cristioglo and other detainees were held in railway wagons for hours at a time over the summer in high temperatures, and not given any food or water during the day. In response to a complaint from his lawyer, the Cahul prosecutor admitted that hygiene regulations were ignored; there were no provisions for refrigeration and preparation of food, nor any facilities for washing dishes or for personal hygiene.
========== MONGOLIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The government passed a resolution in May on the implementation of recommendations issued by UN treaty bodies. This included plans to amend the
Criminal Code to define torture as a crime in line with the UN Convention against Torture. The working group, established under the Ministry of Justice and
Home Affairs in 2010 to draft amendments to the
Criminal Code, appeared to make little progress.
The pre-trial detention facility 461, which opened in early 2011, had installed video cameras in interrogation rooms but there were insufficient safeguards or procedures in place to monitor and prevent misuse of this equipment. 
A working group, set up in June 2010 by the
Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights, continued to investigate allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of Enkhbat Damiran and his lawyer.
Enkhbat Damiran was kidnapped in France in 2003 and brought to Mongolia where he was charged with the murder of Zorig Sanjaasuren, a prominent pro- democracy activist and politician. Enkhbat Damiran claimed he was tortured while in detention. He died in2007. 
His lawyer, Lodoisambuu Sanjaasuren (no relation to the victim), was also arrested and convicted of exposing state secrets.

The Ombudsperson reported in July on overcrowding and inadequate detention conditions in almost all police stations. In November, six NGOs were authorized by the Ministry of Justice to monitor prisons and other institutions for possible violations including torture and other ill-treatment.

On 16-17 May, prisoners convicted of terrorism- related offences held at Salé Prison rioted in protest against their unfair trials and the use of torture at the secret Témara detention centre. They clashed with guards, briefly holding several hostage, before the prison authorities used live ammunition to quell the riots. Several prisoners were injured. 
In late May, Moroccan/German national Mohamed
Hajib serving a 10-year prison term needed hospital treatment after he was severely beaten and threatened with rape by guards at Toulal Prison in Meknes, to where he had been moved after participating in the unrest at Salé Prison.

Of 989 prisoners interviewed, 74 per cent reported being tortured in custody.
Torture has yet to be criminalized under domestic
Nepalese law. During the first assessment of its human rights record under the UN Universal Periodic

Alleged methods included beatings, suspension by the wrists or ankles, and enforced standing or sitting in painful positions (shabeh) for long periods. The ICHR also received complaints of torture and other ill-treatment of suspects by police – over 50 in the West Bank and 100 in Gaza.
In Gaza, four people died in custody in suspicious circumstances. ‘Adel

Mare Psychiatric Hospital. The official investigation into the circumstances of his death was allegedly marked by procedural irregularities. It did not result in any charges against staff from the institutions where he was kept during the last months of his life. The case was brought to the Court by NGOs, the Centre for Legal
Resources and INTERIGHTS, who asked the Court to adapt its admissibility criteria so as to allow NGOs to bring cases on behalf of a person with disabilities, even in the absence of specific authorization. The NGOs argued that inappropriate care and living conditions at the psychiatric hospital directly contributed to Valentin
Câmpeanu’s death.

The new law on the police, which came into force in

However, there were no substantive new provisions for strengthening the accountability of the police or to combat impunity for violations by law enforcement officials, and the law’s benefits remained elusive. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment remained widespread. Allegations281Amnesty 
International Report 2012
were seldom effectively investigated and documented injuries were often dismissed as resulting from the legitimate use of force. The successful prosecution of perpetrators was rare. The denial of adequate medical care in custody was widely reported, and was allegedly used to extract confessions. Convicted prisoners frequently reported being subjected to violence, by both prison officials and inmates, shortly after their arrival in prison. 
The trial of two police officers on charges of abuse of power, including in relation to the unlawful detention and torture of Zelimkhan Chitigov in April 2010, began in September, the first such case ever to have reached court in Ingushetia. Reportedly, several of those who had testified against the two police officers were subjected to a campaign of pressure and intimidation. 
Armen Sargsyan was detained by police in Orenburg on 18 November as a suspect in a theft case and died hours later, according to the police of acute heart failure.

ICD’s original mandatory investigation obligations were expanded to include incidents of torture and rape by police. Police failure to report suspected incidents or obstruction of ICD/IPID investigations were made criminal offences.
In July, the National Commissioner of correctional services ordered an internal inquiry into the alleged torture of a prisoner by six prison officers using an electric shock stun device. A police investigation was also instituted, but no progress had been reported by the end of the year.
A draft law to make torture a criminal offence had not been presented in Parliament by the end of the year.
========== SOUTH SUDAN ==========
Torture, other ill-treatment and enforced disappearances
Security forces including the South Sudan Police
Service (SSPS) harassed, arrested, tortured or otherwise ill-treated people, including UN and NGO staff. A number of individuals were subjected to enforced disappearance. On 26 July, the President ordered the dissolution of South Sudan’s national security and intelligence special branch, and its public security branch. The former director of public security and criminal investigation, General Marial
Nour Jok, was arrested and detained on 30 July following allegations of his involvement in the creation of illegal detention centres, as well as torture and corruption. 
The whereabouts of John Louis Silvino, an architect at the Ministry of Housing, remained unknown following his disappearance on 25 March. 
In October, four police officers were arrested and faced trial after Jackline Wani, aged 17, was tortured by police from the Criminal Investigation Department following allegations of theft on 13 June.
========== SPAIN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were allegations of excessive use of force by law enforcement officials during demonstrations by the 15M movement across Spain between May and August. 
On 27 May, riot police officers of the autonomous
Catalan police force intervened to disperse demonstrators from Catalonia Square in Barcelona.
Medical evidence and video footage corroborated reports that riot police hit apparently peaceful demonstrators with their batons and fired rubber bullets at them. The police officers did not appear to wear identification numbers on their uniform. On8 
June, the Catalan government stated that no inquiry into the allegations of excessive use of force was necessary. 
Angela Jaramillo reported that while she stood alone, close to the demonstration in Calle Castellana in Madrid on 4 August, a riot police officer hit her in the face and on the legs. Another woman who assisted Angela
Jaramillo said she was also repeatedly hit with batons by riot police and suffered injuries on her neck, hip and legs. Both filed complaints against the police the following day. 
On 17 October, the High Court of Barcelona sentenced two municipal police officers to 27 months’ imprisonment for the torture of a student from Trinidad and Tobago in September 2006. The same two police officers had been involved in another incident earlier in2006,  and three other men had filed complaints of ill- treatment against them, but investigations into those allegations had been closed in July 2007.
In January, the Catalan government abolished the
Code of Police Ethics, which had implemented the
European Code of Police Ethics. The Police Ethics
Committee, which was mandated to receive and examine complaints from individuals about police conduct and to assess police compliance with the
Code of Police Ethics, was suspended after most of its members resigned. 
At the end of the year, two police officers, charged with killing Osamuyia Akpitaye while he was being forcibly deported from Spain in June 2007, had not been put on trial. 
In November, the Supreme Court acquitted four civil guards convicted by the Criminal Court of Guipúzcoa in
December 2010 for torturing Igor Portu and Mattin
Sarasola while they were in police custody on 6 January2008.311Amnesty 
International Report 2012
 Ali Aarrass, a Moroccan/Belgian national suspected of terrorism-related offences in Morocco, was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment in Rabat in
November. He had been extradited from Spain to
Morocco in December 2010 in breach of interim measures ordered by the UN Human Rights Committee, after which his lawyers in Belgium repeatedly alleged that the Moroccan security services tortured him during interrogation and that he did not receive a fair trial. A complaint before the Human Rights Committee against
Spain was still pending at the end of the year. 
Mohamed Zaher Asade and Hasan Alhusein, two
Syrian nationals released from prison in September2010  after completing eight-year sentences for terrorism-related offences, remained under threat of expulsion to Syria despite facing a real risk of torture or other ill-treatment there. Mohamed Zaher Asade had lodged an appeal against his expulsion, but his request to suspend the enforcement of his expulsion pending a final decision was dismissed. An expulsion order issued against Hasan Alhusein in August was pending at the end of the year.
========== SRI LANKA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of criminal suspects and those detained on suspicion of links to the LTTE remained widespread, despite laws prohibiting torture.
Rape and other gender-based violence amounting to torture were not taken seriously by the authorities.
Sexual violence went largely under-reported and, where reported, was poorly investigated.
========== SUDAN ==========
========== SWAZILAND ==========
========== SWEDEN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Sweden failed again to introduce torture as a crime in its Penal Code. 
On 2 August, Ahmed Agiza was released from prison in Cairo, Egypt, having been held for over nine years following an unfair trial before a military court. Ahmed
Agiza and Mohammed al-Zari, both Egyptian asylum- seekers, were detained in Sweden in December 2001 and subjected to rendition from Sweden to Egypt on a
CIA-leased plane. Both men subsequently reported that they had been tortured and ill-treated while being held incommunicado in Egypt. In 2008, the Swedish government awarded both men financial compensation for the human rights violations they had suffered.
However, an effective, impartial, thorough and independent investigation into these violations remained outstanding.322 
Following his release, Ahmed Agiza applied for a residence permit in Sweden in order to be reunited with his family who still lived there. Awarding him a residence permit would help to ensure that he received full and effective redress for the violations he had suffered.
========== SWITZERLAND ==========
========== SYRIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees were widespread and committed with impunity by the security forces with the aims of obtaining information, coercing “confessions” and punishing and terrorizing those suspected of opposing the government. Some victims feared that they would face reprisals if their identities were disclosed. 
A man detained in April in Banias said that he was held for three days without food or clean drinking water and that security forces beat him and others with rifle butts on the neck and shoulders, stripped and beat him with sticks and cables, and made him lick his own blood off the floor. 
A man said that he was beaten until he lost consciousness, tortured with electric shocks and threatened that his penis would be severed when he was detained by Military Intelligence in Homs in May.
He then agreed to thumb print while blindfolded documents he had not read. 
A man from Damascus was whipped, suspended, deprived of sleep and had cold water repeatedly poured over him while naked following his arrest in May when he was held by State Security officials in
Damascus. He became ill but was denied medical treatment.
========== TAIWAN ==========
========== TAJIKISTAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Police and security forces continued to use torture and other ill-treatment with almost total impunity, despite changes to the law in 2010. The European
Court of Human Rights issued emergency measures to prevent the extradition of a man to Tajikistan, due to the prevalence of torture in the country. At the end of the year the government announced its intention to amend the Criminal Code with a definition of torture, in line with international law. 
Safarali Sangov died on 5 March, four days after being arrested by police officers of the Sino District in
Dushanbe. During the arrest, police reportedly beat him and other family members, including children and a woman who was four months pregnant. Following a public outcry and allegations that Safarali Sangov died as a result of torture at the police station, two policemen were charged in March with “negligence” and one with“exceeding  authority”. However, the prosecution subsequently dropped the latter charge, stating that testimonies of Safarali Sangov’s relatives were not acceptable as evidence. After a legal battle, the case was transferred to the General Prosecutor’s office for review. 
The trial against Ilhom Ismonov and 52 co- defendants began on 11 July at Soghd Regional Court in northern Tajikistan. All were accused of membership of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and of participating in organized crime. On 19 July, he and several others told the judge that they had been tortured in pre-trial detention. On 16 September, Ilhom
Ismonov told the judge that he had been pressurized by officials to retract his earlier allegations of torture and other ill-treatment. He had not dared speak out earlier, fearing retaliation from law enforcement agencies. The judge ignored his statement. His confession, allegedly obtained under torture, was used as evidence against him. The Prosecutor requested a 12-year prison sentence. The case was ongoing at the end of the year.
========== TANZANIA ==========
========== THAILAND ==========
========== TIMOR-LESTE ==========
========== TOGO ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture in pre-trial detention was widespread in order to extract confessions or implicate defendants. 
In March, Sow Bertin Agba was arrested for fraud and tortured while held in handcuffs for five days in a garage at the National Intelligence Agency premises.
He suffered a fractured arm and wounds all over his body. By the end of the year, he was still detained without trial at the civil prison in Tsévié. 
In September, 33 people accused of plotting against the State, including Kpatcha Gnassingbé, half-brother of the President, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 20 years by the Supreme Court. Immediately after the trial, the Minister of Justice asked the National
Commission on Human Rights to investigate the torture allegations. It had not published its conclusions by the end of the year.
========== TRINIDAD AND ==========
========== TOBAGO ==========
========== TUNISIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment but on a far reduced scale compared to previous years. In most cases, complainants alleged that they had been beaten by police when they were arrested during protests or while being taken to or detained at police stations. 
Fouad Badrouci, a student aged 17, was arrested by masked police officers in Tunis on 6 May after a protest.
They punched, kicked and beat him with batons before taking him with several other young protesters to
Bouchoucha Prison. There, the detainees were forced to stand with their arms and one leg raised for a prolonged period, beaten and denied food and water.
They were made to sign blank papers and were then released early the next day. Fouad Badrouci’s injuries included a broken nose, right arm and rib. 
Mohamed Sidki Hlimi alleged that he was raped and otherwise tortured by police officers who summoned him to an army camp in Kasserine in
March after he blamed a senior police officer for deaths during the protests against President Ben ‘Ali.
He said that he was handcuffed and shackled throughout his seven days of detention, and kept naked after the first night when he was stripped, suspended from a pole, beaten and raped. He was beaten again when he refused to sign a statement incriminating people he did not know in the burning of police stations. He was then released.
Following his visit to Tunisia in May, the UN Special
Rapporteur on torture urged the government to instruct all police and other law enforcement officials that torture and other ill-treatment are prohibited and to ensure that those who commit such abuses are held criminally liable.
========== TURKEY ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment in and during transfer to police stations and prisons persisted. Police routinely used excessive force during demonstrations, notably during protests before and after the June elections. In many cases, demonstrations became violent following police intervention and the use of pepper gas, water cannon and plastic bullets. In many instances, media documented law enforcement officials beating demonstrators with batons. 
In May and June, demonstrations in the city of Hopa in the north-eastern Artvin province of Turkey led to clashes between police and protesters, where one demonstrator died and others were injured. Metin
Lokumcu died of a heart attack after being overcome by pepper gas fired by police. Demonstrators in Ankara protesting the policing of the Hopa demonstrations were also subjected to police violence. According to her lawyer, demonstrator Dilşat Aktaş was beaten by around 10 police officers, leaving her with a broken hip and unable to walk for six months. A criminal investigation into the incident had not concluded at the end of the year. The alleged assault by police officers was the second involving Dilşat Aktaş. In March, television cameras showed her being punched by a police officer, during a protest, yet the Ankara prosecutor decided not to pursue the case. 
In October, army conscript Uğur Kantar died in hospital, reportedly as a result of torture inflicted by soldiers while he was in military custody within his garrison in northern Cyprus. Five officials, including the342 
military prison director, were indicted for causing his death. The prosecution was continuing at the end of the year.
========== TURKMENISTAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued reports of torture or other ill- treatment of human rights defenders, journalists, and certain religious minorities by police, officers of the
Ministry of National Security and prison personnel.
The authorities failed to carry out effective investigations into such allegations.
In June the Committee against Torture published its Concluding Observations on Turkmenistan. The
Committee expressed concern at the “numerous and consistent allegations about the widespread practice of torture and ill-treatment of detainees”.
========== UGANDA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
A number of political leaders and their supporters were ill-treated during their arrest by police and other security personnel. 
On 28 April, Dr Kizza Besigye (see above) suffered serious injuries during his arrest by police and unidentified law enforcement personnel. Government officials stated that the level of force used against him was justified.
In June, the Uganda Human Rights Commission reported that torture and other ill-treatment by the police, other law enforcement officials and the military remained widespread.
========== UKRAINE ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continuing reports of torture and other ill- treatment in police custody. The European Court of
Human Rights ruled in nine cases against Ukraine, finding that Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, which prohibits torture, had been violated. 
Firdovsi Safarov, a Ukrainian citizen of Azeri ethnic origin, told Amnesty International that, on 26 March, he had been beaten by six police officers from Mohiliov
Podilsky police station. He had been stopped by police officers while taking an old car to a scrap yard. He was punched in the head and racially abused. At the station, the Director and other police officers beat him intermittently until 1am, when he was released.
Firdovsi Safarov said that he had been asked to pay
US$3,000 to be released. He was later charged with resisting police officers, but was acquitted on 25 June.
Firdovsi Safarov lodged a complaint about the ill- treatment and, after two refusals, the Prosecutor’s
Office opened an investigation in July. Although the investigation was ongoing, the Director of the police station remained in post at the end of the year. In
October, Firdovsi Safarov was rehospitalized due to the injuries he had received, but his treatment was stopped early, reportedly because police officers pressurized the doctors treating him.
========== UNITED ARAB ==========
========== EMIRATES ==========
========== UNITED KINGDOM ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In July, the terms of reference and protocol for the
Detainee Inquiry were published. It had been established in 2010 to examine allegations of UK involvement in human rights violations of individuals detained abroad in the context of counter-terrorism operations. Concerns were raised that the protocol did not follow international human rights standards,352 
notably because the government would retain the final say over disclosure of material, undermining the
Inquiry’s independence and effectiveness. Solicitors representing individuals who expected their cases to be examined by the Inquiry confirmed they had advised their clients not to participate. Ten NGOs announced that if the Inquiry proceeded as proposed they would not co-operate with it.
The formal launch of the Inquiry was delayed pending the completion of criminal investigations into alleged wrongdoing by UK intelligence agents.
In September, documents discovered in Tripoli,
Libya, indicated that the UK had been involved in the unlawful transfers of Sami Mustafa al-Saadi and
Abdel Hakim Belhaj to Libya in 2004, despite the real risk of torture and other ill-treatment they would have faced there. Both men subsequently initiated civil claims for damages against UK authorities for alleged involvement in the human rights violations they had suffered, including torture and other ill-treatment.
On 3 October, the High Court of England and Wales gave judgement on the lawfulness of guidance to intelligence officers on detention and interrogation operations overseas and intelligence sharing. The
Court ruled that the guidance should be amended to reflect the absolute prohibition on hooding of detainees. However, it rejected arguments that the threshold of risk used to assess whether a detainee would be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment relied on in the guidance was unlawful.
In December, the government wrote to the US authorities asking them to transfer Yunus Rahmatullah to UK custody, after the Court of Appeal ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued in his case. Yunus
Rahmatullah was captured by British forces in Iraq in
February 2004 and handed over to US forces who transferred him to Afghanistan and had kept him since then detained without charge in Bagram.
Legal and policy developments
In January, the Home Office published its review of six counter-terrorism and security powers. Later that month, the maximum period of pre-charge detention in terrorism cases was reduced from 28 to 14 days.
However, in February the government published draft legislation which would allow the maximum period to be raised back to 28 days in response to an unspecified future urgent situation. 
On 13 July, in the case of Al Rawi and others v. The
Security Services and others , the Supreme Court ruled that courts could not order a “closed material procedure” – which would allow the government to rely on secret material in closed sessions of the court – in a civil trial for damages without the statutory power to do so.
In October, the government put forward new legislative proposals in the Justice and Security Green
Paper. Some of these gave rise to concern. They included expansion of the use of closed material procedures in civil proceedings, including in civil trials for damages, and measures which would restrict the ability of victims of human rights violations from seeking disclosure before domestic courts of material related to those violations on national security grounds. The Green Paper did, however, include some limited proposals to improve oversight of the security and intelligence services.
Control orders
As of 14 December, nine individuals, all British nationals, were under control orders.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which provided for the control order regime, was repealed in December. It was replaced by the Terrorism
Prevention and Investigation Measures Act, which provided for a new regime of administratively-ordered restrictions (TPIMs) which can be placed on an individual who is suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. Although slightly narrower than those applied under the control order regime, the restrictions could still amount to deprivation of liberty or constitute restrictions on the rights to privacy, expression, association and movement.
Following a transition period, TPIMs were expected to fully replace the control orders regime in early 2012.
The government also provided for an “enhanced” version of TPIMs, which could be introduced in future undefined exceptional circumstances, where the most severe restrictions currently available under the control orders regime may be re-imposed.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Despite assertions by the authorities that the practice of torture had significantly decreased, and the introduction of new legislation to improve the treatment of detainees, dozens of reports of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners emerged throughout the year. In most cases, the authorities failed to conduct prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into these allegations.
In September, the President approved a new law on the treatment of individuals in pre-charge and pre- trial detention. The new legislation allowed, among other things, for an unrestricted number of visits of undefined length by detainees’ relatives and lawyers and abolished the need to obtain prior permission from the investigating security officers. However, by the end of December there was scant evidence that the law was being implemented consistently and effectively.
Despite a handful of well-publicized releases, several thousand people convicted of involvement with banned Islamist parties or Islamic movements, as well as government critics, political opponents and human rights activists, continued to serve long prison terms under conditions that amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Many had their prison terms extended for allegedly violating prison rules of conduct following summary and closed trials held inside detention facilities. 
On 19 May, the poet and government critic Yusuf
Juma was unexpectedly released from Yaslik prison after serving three years of a five-year sentence for resisting arrest and injuring police officers, charges he claimed were politically motivated. He was secretly taken to Tashkent Airport and put on a plane to the
USA. Yusuf Juma said that he was forced to renounce his Uzbekistani citizenship in exchange for joining his family in the USA where they had been given political asylum. In an interview with Radio Ozodlyk (the Uzbek
Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) he maintained that he had been tortured and otherwise ill- treated throughout his imprisonment, regularly spending 15 days in solitary confinement in punishment cells. He said that prison personnel and law enforcement officers used torture routinely to extract confessions from detainees or punish prisoners.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment of detainees by the security forces. The most commonly reported methods were beatings, electric shocks, burning with cigarettes and suspension by the limbs, often for long periods. 
In February, detainees at the Political Security prison in Sana’a, including alleged al-Qa’ida members or supporters, were reported to have been beaten by guards and held in solitary confinement after going on hunger strike to protest against their prolonged detention without charge or trial, ill-treatment and denial of adequate medical care. At least 10 detainees were said to have required hospital treatment as a result of the beatings. 
Mustafa Abdu Yahya al-Nahari was reported to have been repeatedly kicked, beaten, and whipped by
Central Security officials, who held him at an unknown place for a week after they arrested him at his home on14 
November. He was kept blindfolded throughout, interrogated about the protests and made to sign a document without knowing what it contained, then released by being left, still blindfolded, in a street.
