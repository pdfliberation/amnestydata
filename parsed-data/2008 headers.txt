In the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the Amnesty International Report 2008 is dedicated to the courageous women and men who continue to put their lives on the line to defend human rights.
Every day, human rights defenders challenge the powerful, expose the truth, and give voice to the voiceless.
The Amnesty International Report documents the state of human rights in 150 countries. It reveals a world riven by inequality, scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression.
In every region of the world rights are violated with impunity.
People are killed and tortured because of their beliefs; women die for want of basic health care in childbirth; whole communities are made intentionally homeless by ruthless governments seeking to exploit their land.
Over the last 60 years, the world has slowly come to embrace human rights, and understand their promise.
This report shows why if we are to realize the Declaration’s vision of “freedom from want” as well as “from fear” there is only one possible way forward: working to ensure that the indivisibility of the rights enshrined in the Declaration is a living reality for all.
