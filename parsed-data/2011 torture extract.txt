Torture and other ill-treatment
Charges of torture continued to be brought very rarely, except where incidents of ill-treatment by police resulted in serious injury or death; police officers were generally prosecuted for the lesser offence of “arbitrary acts”, usually punished by a fine. 
In April, on the recommendation of the
Ombudsperson, an investigation was begun against two police officers in Tirana suspected of torture. They were accused of having severely beaten three young men during and after their arrest in 2009. On completion of the investigation in December, the two police officers were charged with “arbitrary acts”. 
In October, Tirana District Court found police officer
Vlash Ashiku guilty of having, while on duty, punched
Tomor Shehu around the face and head in 2008. He was convicted of “arbitrary acts” and sentenced to a small fine (US$15).
The European Committee for the Prevention of
Torture visited Albania in May to review measures taken to implement its previous recommendations.

The UN Human Rights Committee, the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights expressed serious concerns at reports of torture and other ill- treatment in prisons and police stations, particularly in Buenos Aires and Mendoza provinces. In January, a Provincial Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture was approved by legislators in Chaco province.
However, a similar national mechanism, which is required under the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture, had still not been put in place by the end of the year.
========== ARMENIA ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
In May 2010, the UN Committee against Torture reiterated its concerns regarding the absence of the crime of torture in Austria’s Criminal Code, the high level of impunity for abuses by police and the lenient sentences imposed by courts in cases of torture or other ill-treatment. 
The European Court of Human Rights began to examine the complaint of Gambian national Bakary J., alleging that his expulsion from Austria would result in a violation of his right to family life and his right not to be ill- treated. Bakary J., who was tortured by four police officers in 2006 following an unsuccessful deportation, has yet to receive reparation. The officers received suspended sentences of less than one year in August 2006. 
In November, proceedings against a police officer charged with grievous bodily harm continued before the Regional Criminal Court in Vienna. US citizen Mike
B., an African-American teacher, was injured by an undercover policeman on 11 February 2009 in an underground station in Vienna.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture of detainees held by the police or other security forces reportedly led to the death of at least six individuals. Six police officers were reportedly investigated for torturing detainees but no one was brought to trial. A private member’s bill criminalizing torture remained pending before parliament. 
Mahmoodur Rahman, editor of Amar Desh newspaper, was detained on 2 June for allegedly running the paper without a valid licence. He testified before a magistrate that police officers had beaten him severely while he was in custody. 
At least six garment workers detained in early
August, one of whom was pregnant, were beaten by police officers during interrogation. Their arrest followed a wave of garment workers’ street rallies calling for higher wages.
========== BELARUS ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment 
In August, Belarus submitted its fourth periodic report to the UN Committee against Torture. The report rejected the recommendation made by the Committee in 2000 to introduce a definition of torture into the Criminal Code in accordance with the definition in the UN Convention against Torture, and claimed that all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment were examined by prosecutors. However, according to a shadow report submitted by NGOs in December, complaints to the
Prosecutor’s Office rarely led to criminal investigations for torture and were usually subject to a superficial investigation which did not extend beyond interviewing the police officers alleged to be the perpetrators.76 
 On 18 January the Prosecutor of Soviet district in
Minsk turned down a request for a criminal investigation into allegations of torture made by Pavel
Levshin. He had been detained by police officers from
Soviet district police station on 9 December 2009 on suspicion of theft. Pavel Levshin claims that on 10
December from 5pm to 8pm police officers subjected him to torture and other ill-treatment. In his complaint to the prosecutor he claimed that police handcuffed him, laid him on his stomach and inserted his feet behind his hands in a position known as “the swallow”.
They beat him with a rubber truncheon and with plastic bottles filled with water. They also put a plastic bag over his head and held it there five times until he came close to suffocating. A forensic medical report confirmed that he had injuries consistent with his allegations, but the
Prosecutor quoted the police report and stated that no evidence of torture had been found.

Torture, other ill-treatment and prison conditions
Torture was widespread at the point of detention and in police cells, prisons and juvenile detention systems. 
In April, a motorcycle courier was tortured to death inside a military police base in São Paulo. He died after being repeatedly kicked in the face and beaten with sticks and a chain by a group of police officers. Twelve police officers were later charged in connection with the death.
Prisons remained severely overcrowded and inmates were held in conditions amounting to cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment. The authorities had effectively lost control of many facilities, leading to a series of riots and homicides. 
In October, rival factions killed 18 prisoners, four of whom were decapitated, in two facilities in Maranhão state. The riots began after prisoners complained about overcrowding, the poor quality of the food and lack of access to water.
In November, following criticism by the state
Human Rights Commission and local NGOs, the
Espírito Santo state authorities closed the Judicial
Police Department in Vila Velha, which had been holding up to eight times as many prisoners as it was designed to house and which had been the subject  of repeated torture allegations. The controversial use of shipping containers to house prisoners in several units was also stopped. Nevertheless, inspections by the National Council of Justice reported continuing problems, including overcrowding and insanitary conditions, especially in the Tucum Women’s Prison.
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture – ratified by Brazil in 2007 – remained stalled in the
Office of the President’s Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, two states, Alagoas and Rio de Janeiro, approved laws to implement the Optional Protocol in May and June respectively.
========== BULGARIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Serious concerns were raised over the treatment of children in social care homes, and the adequacy  of previous investigations into excessive use of force.
Children in social care homes 
In September, the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee published the results of its investigation into cases of deaths of children with mental disabilities in social care homes carried out in collaboration with the Prosecution
Service. The investigation found evidence of 238 deaths which occurred between 2000 and 2010. The causes of death established during the research included starvation, neglect, general physical deterioration, infections, freezing to death, pneumonia and also violence. The NGO suggested that at least three quarters of these deaths could have been avoidable and that a large number of these deaths had never been investigated. Following publication, criminal investigations were reportedly initiated into166 cases.
========== BURKINA FASO ==========
========== BURUNDI ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Between the end of June and early July, the SNR reverted to old practices of torture not seen in recent years. Twelve individuals arrested as part of the90 
government’s investigations into grenade attacks were allegedly subjected to physical and psychological torture and other ill-treatment by the SNR. They were slapped, kicked and hit with batons and reported receiving death threats as security agents tried to extract confessions.
Only one further torture case was reported after the
UN, the diplomatic community and human rights organizations raised these cases with the government.
The government committed to opening investigations, but had not done so by the end of year. None of the suspected perpetrators were suspended pending investigations.
Three police officers were convicted on 7 June by the High Court in Muramvya of ill-treating detainees thought to be FNL members in Rutegama in October2007. However, authorities failed to execute the judgement; two officers were still serving in the police force by the end of the year and a third had been jailed on other charges in 2009.

Torture and killings of people accused of witchcraft
Women and men accused of witchcraft were frequently subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, or even killed. Government and security officials condoned the accusations and the ill-treatment, and took no action to protect the victims or bring those responsible for abuses to justice. 
Betty Kimbembe, the 35-year-old mother of a four- month-old baby, and two men were severely beaten in
April by government soldiers and a son of President
Bozizé, reportedly after the president’s son accused them of witchcraft.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment remained endemic in places of detention. Amnesty International received reports of deaths in custody, some of them caused by torture, in a variety of state institutions, including prisons and police detention centres. In July, new regulations were introduced to strengthen prohibitions against the use of illegal oral evidence in criminal cases, including coerced confessions. However,
China’s Criminal Procedure Law had not yet been amended to explicitly prohibit the use of confessions obtained through torture and ill-treatment as evidence before the courts.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment by members of the security services were reported in detention centres, including the central prison in Brazzaville. 
Ferdinand Mbourangon died in September after being beaten by gendarmes at the central prison in
Brazzaville. He had been part of a protest against the prison authorities’ refusal to allow a fellow inmate to attend his child’s funeral. Ferdinand Mbourangon was taken to a military hospital for treatment but prison authorities rejected a doctor’s recommendation that he should be hospitalized. An autopsy reportedly established that he had suffered internal bleeding. It was unclear whether the authorities took any action in connection with his death. 
André Bakekolo, a retired police officer, was severely beaten when he went to Ouenze police station in
Brazzaville to complain that police officers had taken his property. The police had been looking for his son, who had been involved in a traffic accident. The commander of the police station was reportedly suspended after André Bakekolo complained to the authorities.

On 20 August, FARDC soldiers in Kasando, North
Kivu, reportedly tortured five people, including two children, arrested after an attack on the MONUSCO base in Kirumba. They received between 40 and 120 lashes each, and some had their feet and hands burned and mutilated. They were transferred to the
Military Prosecutor in Goma.
========== DENMARK ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In November, a local court ruled that the extradition  of Niels Holck, a Danish national, to India could not proceed after determining that diplomatic assurances negotiated between the Danish and Indian government did not offer sufficient protection against the risk of torture and other ill-treatment. The government appealed the case, which at the end of the year remained pending at the High Court.
In December, the Copenhagen Municipal Court ruled that the mass pre-emptive arrests of 250 people during the 2009 Climate Change Conference in
Copenhagen were unlawful, and furthermore that the circumstances under which the arrests took place in178 of those cases constituted degrading treatment, in violation of article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights.
The problem of minors on remand being detained in the same facilities as adult inmates persisted.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of security detainees and criminal suspects were systematic in police stations, prisons and SSI detention centres and, for the most part, committed with impunity. In some instances, police assaulted suspects openly and in public as if unconcerned about possible consequences. In other instances, police were reported to have threatened victims against lodging complaints. In April, the Interior Ministry agreed to pay a total of 10 million Egyptian pounds (US$1.76 million) as compensation to 840 members of Gamaa
Islamiya, an Islamist group, who had been tortured; however, no action is known to have been taken against those responsible for their torture.
In rare cases, the authorities prosecuted police alleged to have committed assaults, although generally these were cases that had received wide publicity.
Those convicted tended to receive lenient sentences. 
Taha Abdel Tawwab Mohamed, a medical doctor, said he was stripped and beaten by SSI officers in
Fayoum on 7 March because of his public support for
Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, who the authorities consider a government critic. He was released the next day. His lawyer filed a complaint but no action was known to have been taken.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Soldiers and police officers tortured and ill-treated detainees and others with impunity, particularly in
Bata, despite a law prohibiting torture. At least two people reportedly died as a result of torture. The four men abducted from Benin and later executed were repeatedly tortured during their detention. 
Manuel Napo Pelico died in July in Basakato de la
Sagrada Familia, Bioko Island. Soldiers went to his house to arrest him for refusing to take part in the collective cleaning of the village. They reportedly hit him on the head with the butt of a gun, then dragged him to the military barracks where they left him unconscious and bleeding. When they realized he was dying, they took him back to his home where he died soon after. By the end of the year, his death had not been investigated and those responsible had not been brought to justice.
========== ERITREA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The use of torture in detention facilities was widespread. Detainees, including prisoners of conscience, were often tortured and ill-treated. The most frequent forms of torture reported were whippings, beatings and being tied with ropes in painful positions for prolonged periods.
Prison conditions were extremely harsh, with many prisoners held in overcrowded, unhygienic and damp conditions. Large numbers of detainees were held in underground cells and others were locked in metal shipping containers, many in desert locations creating extreme temperatures. Prisoners were given inadequate food and unclean drinking water. Almost no medical assistance was available. Various prisoners of conscience and political prisoners were reported to have died in detention, but most reports were not confirmed by the authorities. 
Hana Hagos Asgedom, a Christian imprisoned for nearly four years for her religious beliefs, died in
January. She was reportedly beaten with an iron rod for refusing the sexual advances of an officer at the Alla
Military Camp and died from a heart attack soon after.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In its concluding observations of 14 May 2010, the
UN Committee against Torture expressed concern at the persistent allegations of ill-treatment by French law enforcement officials, and urged the authorities to carry out prompt, transparent and independent investigations into such allegations, and ensure adequate punishment for perpetrators. 
On 4 November, the European Court of Human
Rights found that France had violated the European
Convention on Human Rights’ prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment in the case Darraj v. France. In July2001, Yassine Darraj, a 16-year-old French national, was taken for an identity check to a police station, where police officers handcuffed him and used force which required an emergency operation and resulted in his unfitness for work for 21 days. The Court ruled that the 800 euro fine for “involuntary injuries”, to which two of the police officers were sentenced on appeal, was inadequate.
========== GAMBIA ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
The authorities’ failure to ensure that human rights violations by the police were adequately investigated, insufficient information about procedures to file criminal complaints, and difficulties in the identification of police officers may have led to impunity for the perpetrators and jeopardized victims’ access to justice and redress.
Allegations of ill-treatment continued and independent police complaints bodies mandated to investigate allegations of human rights violations by law enforcement officials were not established. Only a few federal states provided information on their websites about how to complain about police misconduct. 
On 3 March, the Public Prosecutor’s General Office terminated investigations in the alleged ill-treatment by police officers of a photojournalist during the 2007
Rostock G8 summit, claiming that it was impossible to identify them with sufficient certainty. Berlin was the only federal state to introduce compulsory individual identification for uniformed police – to be implemented in January 2011. No obligation for police officers to wear identity badges was in place in the rest of the country. 
In the criminal proceedings into the death of Oury
Jalloh, who died in 2005 of heat inhalation following a fire in his cell while in police custody in Dessau, the
Federal Court of Justice overruled the acquittal of one police officer on 7 January and ordered a retrial. The first instance proceedings, concluded in 2008, had highlighted serious shortcomings in the thoroughness of the early stage of the investigations. 
According to protesters, the police, deployed to protect a large infrastructure project in Stuttgart, used excessive force during a demonstration on 30
September. On 27 October, the regional parliament of
Baden-Württemberg set up a commission of inquiry into the police operation. The Public Prosecutor was investigating the allegations at the end of the year.
========== GHANA ==========
========== GREECE ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were reports of indiscriminate and excessive use of tear gas and other chemicals and excessive use of force against protesters during demonstrations. 
Excessive use of force against peaceful protesters was reported during the commemorative152 
demonstration of the second anniversary of the death of Alexandros Gregoropoulos on 6 December. As a result, a number of protesters reportedly sought hospital treatment, including around 45 with head and other injuries, and around 30 as a result of the excessive use of tear gas and other chemicals. According to reports, some riot police officers beat and injured a photojournalist and a photographer covering the events.
Reports of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials persisted, including against members of vulnerable groups such as detained asylum-seekers and irregular migrants. 
Allegations were made regarding the severe beating of several irregular migrants and asylum-seekers detained at the border guard station of Soufli on 16
August. The detainees had protested over their poor detention conditions. Two days later, three of them were allegedly beaten severely following a hunger strike started by the detainees on the day after the first incident of ill-treatment. 
In October, a special guard was convicted of culpable homicide for shooting 15-year-old Alexandros
Gregoropoulos dead in December 2008, and sentenced to life imprisonment. A second special guard was convicted of complicity in culpable homicide and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.
At the end of his visit in October, the UN Special
Rapporteur on torture called for the ratification of the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and the establishment of an independent and effective police complaints mechanism. In December, a Draft
Law provided for the establishment of a bureau dealing with incidents of arbitrary behaviour by law enforcement officials. Concerns remained over the independence and effectiveness of the proposed bureau.
========== GUATEMALA ==========
========== GUINEA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by the security forces continued. Most people arrested arbitrarily were beaten at the time of their arrests either on the streets or in their homes. Some were also beaten at the gendarmerie headquarters and in police stations. 
In October, the security forces ransacked several areas of Conakry, the capital, including Bambeto, Koza and Hamdallaye. Five people, including Mamadou
Adama Diallo, were beaten and taken to the police station. They were later released without charge. 
Aliou Barry, president of the National Observatory for the Defence of Human Rights, was beaten in October when he tried to protect a group of people in
Hamdallaye from assault by members of the security forces. His left arm was broken and he was taken to the gendarmerie headquarters and held for a few hours before being released without charge.
========== GUINEA-BISSAU ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In July, Fernando Té died in hospital a few days after being arrested and beaten by police officers stationed at the 5th police station in Bissau. According to reports, he was arrested following a dispute with a shopkeeper and taken to the police station, where he was beaten before being released without charge a few hours later. Two days after his death, the police officers involved were arrested. However, by the end of the year they had not apparently been charged or tried.
========== GUYANA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Judicial proceedings against three police officers charged in connection with the torture and ill- treatment in October 2009 of three people, including a 15-year-old boy, in Leonora police station stalled in the courts. One of the victims was reported to have accepted a compensation payment and the relative of another victim stated that the case had been“settled”. The three officers accused in the case remained on active duty at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
The security forces tortured and otherwise ill-treated detainees, particularly criminal suspects from poor and marginalized communities, and those suspected of pro-independence activities in Papua and Maluku provinces. Accountability mechanisms put in place to deal with violations remained inadequate. 
Two videos emerged during the year showing members of the police and military torturing and otherwise ill-treating Papuan men. The first video showed Yawan Wayeni, a Papuan political activist, just before his death in August 2009. Despite severe abdominal injuries, he was denied medical assistance by the police, who accused him of being an insurgent.
He had been arrested earlier by members of the Police
Mobile Brigade at his house in Yapen Island, Papua.
The second video published online in October showed
Papuans being kicked and otherwise physically abused by members of the Indonesian military, and two Papuan men being tortured during interrogation. Indonesian officials confirmed the authenticity of both videos. 
Yusuf Sapakoly, 52, died of kidney failure in a hospital in Ambon, Maluku province, after being refused access to adequate medical assistance by prison authorities. The father of four was arrested in2007 for assisting a group of peaceful political activists who unfurled the “Benang Raja” flag, a symbol of
South Maluku independence, in front of the Indonesian
President. Yusuf Sapakoly required dialysis for kidney failure but was consistently denied treatment by authorities at Nania prison. He also said he did not receive adequate treatment for rib injuries he had suffered in detention.
========== IRAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment in pre-trial detention remained common, facilitated by the routine denial of access to lawyers and continuing impunity for perpetrators. Methods reported included severe beatings; forcing detainees’ heads into toilets to make them ingest human excrement; mock executions; confinement in very small, cramped spaces; deprivation of light, food and water; and denial of medical treatment. In one case, a male detainee was reported to have been raped; others were threatened with rape. 
Details of torture in 2009 continued to emerge. In
February, a former member of the volunteer paramilitary
Basij force described how tens of boys had been rounded up in Shiraz, thrown into shipping containers and systematically raped. After expressing concerns to a Basij leader, he and others were detained for 100 days without access to their families and beaten. He also alleged that he faced a mock execution.
========== IRAQ ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees were rife in Iraqi prisons, especially those controlled by the
Ministries of Defence and Interior. Detainees were beaten with cables and hosepipes, suspended by their limbs for long periods, given electric shocks, had their limbs broken, were asphyxiated with plastic bags, and raped or threatened with rape. Torture was used to extract information from detainees and“confessions” that could be used as evidence against them in court. USF-I secret files published by the
Wikileaks organization in October showed that US soldiers had many times reported evidence of torture by Iraqi security forces to their superiors up to the end of 2009; such reporting apparently did not prompt investigations. 
In April, a secret detention facility was reported to have been uncovered at the former Muthanna airport in central Baghdad in which more than 400 detainees were being held, mostly Sunni Arabs who had been detained in Mosul in late 2009. The secret prison, most of whose inmates said they had been tortured, was reported to be controlled by the office of Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki. The government released about 95 of the detainees and moved others to al-Rusafa Prison in
Baghdad. It denied that the prison was secret but closed it down, arresting three officers of the military unit that had run it.

Consistent allegations of torture and other ill- treatment, including of children, were frequently reported. Among the most commonly cited methods were beatings, threats to the detainee or their family, sleep deprivation, and being subjected to painful stress positions for long periods. Confessions allegedly obtained under duress were accepted as evidence in
Israeli military and civilian courts. 
A.M., a 15-year-old Palestinian from Beit Ummar village near Hebron, was arrested on 26 May, held in
Gush Etzion detention centre, interrogated for six  days allegedly using torture, then released after he“confessed” to throwing stones. He said security officials attached an electric cable to his genitals and threatened to give him electric shocks. In August, two
NGOs, one Palestinian and the other Israeli, filed complaints to the Israeli police and army about his alleged torture. The police complaint was closed on the ground of “insufficient evidence”, while the army was still reviewing the complaint at the end of 2010.
========== ITALY ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In March and May, the Genoa Court of Appeal issued second instance verdicts in the trials on the torture and other ill-treatment perpetrated by law enforcement officials against G8 protesters in 2001.
The opportunity to file appeals with the Court of
Cassation was still open at the end of the year.
In March, the Court recognized that most of the crimes that had taken place at the temporary detention centre of Bolzaneto, including grievous bodily harm and arbitrary inspections and searches, had expired due to the statute of limitations, but still ordered all of the 42 accused to pay civil damages to the victims. The
Court also imposed prison sentences of up to three years and two months on eight of the accused. 
In May, the same Court found 25 of the 28 people accused of similar abuses at the Armando Diaz
School guilty, including all high-ranking police officers present at the time of the events, and imposed prison sentences of up to five years. Many of the charges were dropped due to the statute of limitations.
If Italy had introduced torture as a specific crime in its criminal code, however, the statute of limitations would not have applied.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports of torture and other ill-treatment of security detainees and criminal suspects continued. The authorities failed to institute adequate legal and other safeguards against such abuses.
In May, the UN Committee against Torture reiterated long-standing concerns at Jordan’s failure190 
to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture, to provide adequate protection against torture, and  to prosecute perpetrators in accordance with the seriousness of the crime. It noted the “numerous, consistent and credible allegations of a widespread and routine practice of torture and ill-treatment” including in General Intelligence Department (GID) and Criminal Investigations Department detention.
The government did not respond to the Committee’s recommendations. 
Charges against a police officer relating to an apparently unlawful killing were dropped when the victim’s family agreed not to pursue the case. Fakhri
Anani Kreishan, who died in November 2009 after being attacked by police officers in Ma’an, was found at autopsy to have sustained a lethal head injury caused by a hard object. The police officer alleged to have delivered the blow remained on active duty.
========== KAZAKHSTAN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The authorities introduced a number of measures intended to prevent torture, including widening access to places of detention to independent public monitors and committing publicly to a policy of zero tolerance on torture.
Kazakhstan’s human rights record was assessed under the UN Universal Periodic Review in February.
In its presentation, the government delegation reiterated that the Kazakhstani authorities were committed to a policy of zero tolerance on torture, and that they “would not rest until all vestiges of torture had been fully and totally eliminated”.
In February, the government postponed the creation of an independent detention monitoring mechanism, the National Preventive Mechanism(NPM), for up to three years. However, in line with their obligations under the Optional Protocol to the
UN Convention against Torture, the authorities continued to develop a legal framework for the NPM in close co-operation with domestic and international
NGOs and intergovernmental organizations.
In April, the Prosecutor General’s Office told
Amnesty International that members of Independent
Public Monitoring Commissions had been given unprecedented access to pre-trial detention centres of the National Security Service (NSS); four visits had been carried out in 2009 and eight in 2010.
Despite these measures, people in police custody reported that they were frequently subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, both before and after the formal registration of their detention at a police192 
station. Law enforcement officials often failed to respect the existing law on detention, which requires that they register detainees within three hours of their arrest.
In October, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture criticized Kazakhstan for continuing to conceal the full extent of torture and other ill-treatment in its detention and prison system.

Reports of torture or other ill-treatment in the aftermath of the June violence were widespread.
Beatings by law enforcement officers appeared to continue to be routine: in the street during apprehension, during transfer to detention centres, during initial interrogation, and in pre-charge detention facilities. Search operations by security forces, ostensibly to seize weapons and detain suspects, were reportedly carried out using excessive force. There were serious concerns that the law enforcement operations and criminal investigations in the aftermath of the June violence disproportionately targeted Uzbeks and Uzbek neighbourhoods, while failing to identify and investigate alleged Kyrgyz perpetrators. Hundreds of men, the majority Uzbek, were arbitrarily detained and allegedly beaten during raids and later tortured or otherwise ill-treated in detention. In August, President Otunbaeva reportedly said she was aware that human rights violations had been committed by security forces during the June events and their aftermath, but that she had effectively no control over law enforcement in the south of the country. 
Early on 21 June, security forces entered the Uzbek village of Nariman in Osh region, reportedly beat people with rifle butts and destroyed personal documents during house searches. A spokesperson for the
Ministry of Internal Affairs claimed that the operation was intended to dismantle the barricades which had been erected, arrest suspects and seize weapons.
Reportedly, one man was shot and died on the way to hospital, another was beaten to death and many more were injured. Several men were detained.
========== LAOS ==========

Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports continued of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees and few steps were taken to improve the situation. However, the authorities did permit a visit  of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture to the country in May, and in November announced that they would criminalize all forms of torture and ill- treatment. Detainees continued to be held incommunicado, allegations of torture were not investigated and “confessions” allegedly given under duress were accepted as evidence in trials. The government failed for a further year to submit its first report under the UN Convention against Torture, which Lebanon ratified in 2000. It also failed to establish an independent body empowered to inspect detention centres, as required by the Optional
Protocol to the Convention against Torture to which
Lebanon became party in 2008. 
Mohammad Osman Zayat was reported to have been severely beaten during arrest by plain-clothed members of the ISF on 24 June. While detained at the
ISF’s Information Branch in Beirut, he was repeatedly forced to stand in stress positions, beaten and given electric shocks to sensitive parts of his body. As a result, he signed “confessions” that were expected to be used against him in trial.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In March the Macedonian Helsinki Committee reported that serious shortcomings in psychiatric hospitals often amounted to violations of patients’ rights. Living conditions were described by the
Ombudsperson in September as “catastrophic”. In
September the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture carried out a visit to places of detention, including social care homes and psychiatric hospitals.
Reports of ill-treatment by police continued. 
Roma alleged excessive use of force when 200 riot police took part in shutting down an unofficial market in the Skopje suburb of Šuto Orizari in April. Among those reportedly injured were 17 police officers and, according to the Mayor, more than 40 Romani people. However, NGOs reported that Roma did not complain for fear of retribution. An internal inquiry concluded that the police “had acted within the limits of their competences”. 
The government agreed a friendly settlement with
Jasmina Sulja following her application to the European
Court of Human Rights. She claimed that she had been denied an effective remedy as a result of the authorities’ failure to investigate the death of her partner, Sabri
Asani, an ethnic Albanian, who died after allegedly being beaten in police custody in January 2000.
Counter-terror and security 
In October the European Court of Human Rights sent a communication to the Macedonian authorities following an application by Khaled el-Masri against
Macedonia for its role in his unlawful abduction, detention and ill-treatment for 23 days in Skopje in2003. Following his detention, he was transferred to the custody of US authorities and flown to Afghanistan, where he was allegedly subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.

The authorities regularly caned people for a host of offences, including immigration violations. Caning was provided for more than 60 criminal offences. In one week alone, scores of migrant workers were deported to
Indonesia after being caned for immigration offences. 
In February, three women were caned, for the first time in Malaysia’s history. The women, all Muslims, were convicted of extramarital sex and caned under
Shari’a provisions, near Kuala Lumpur. In April, the first woman sentenced to caning, Kartika Sari Dewi
Shukarno, had her 2009 sentence of six strokes commuted to community service.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Police officers, military personnel and prison guards used torture and other ill-treatment against men and women detained for political reasons or on suspicion of criminal offences. Torture was generally inflicted immediately after arrest in detention centres including the first police brigade and the gendarmerie barracks.
Despite denials by the Mauritanian authorities that torture was still practised, scores of people alleged that they were tortured or ill-treated during the year, including detainees at Dar Naïm prison, Nouakchott central prison and Nouadhibou prison. During a trial held in July and August, although the detainees alleged that they had been tortured, the judge did not order any inquiry. 
Most, if not all, of the 20 or more Malians arrested in
Lemzeirib in February were allegedly tortured by the army. Some were stabbed by soldiers at the time of their arrest and some were burned with cigarettes.

of widespread use of torture and other forms of ill- treatment in police custody” and called on the authorities to publicly and unambiguously condemn torture. It also expressed concern that pre-trial temporary isolation facilities continued to fall under police jurisdiction despite the fact that plans to build new detention centres and transfer management to the Ministry of Justice were part of the Moldova
National Human Rights Action Plan in 2005. Ensuring the separation of the authorities responsible for interrogation and those in charge of detention is an important safeguard against torture and other ill- treatment in detention.

The Committee also urged the authorities to ensure that alleged perpetrators of acts of torture are investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted, convicted and punished.
========== MONTENEGRO ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The Ombudsperson’s Office was established as a
National Prevention Mechanism in line with the Optional
Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, empowered to conduct unannounced visits to places of detention. In March, the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture reported on its 2008 visit,230 
concluding that investigations into alleged ill-treatment needed to be more effective. In October, the NGO Youth
Initiative for Human Rights reported that the Ministry of the Interior had started responding more promptly to allegations reported by the NGO, and that some police officers had subsequently been disciplined or charged. 
In January, Dalibor Nikezić and Igor Milić, detainees at Spuž prison, filed a new complaint against prison guards, alleging they had been ill-treated and threatened to force them to withdraw a previous complaint. Their first complaint was rejected by the State Prosecutor in
February. Despite viewing a prison surveillance video(showing the men being dragged from their cells and beaten), she found no basis for a criminal prosecution.

========== WESTERN SAHARA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment, notably by the Directorate for Surveillance of the Territory (DST) and, in some instances, the
National Brigade of the Judicial Police, in most cases apparently committed with impunity. The most frequently reported methods included beatings, electric shocks and threats of rape. The victims included security suspects held by the DST and other criminal suspects. 
Mohamed Sleimani, Abdalla Balla, Bouali M’naouar,
Hicham el-Hawari, Izaddine Sleimani, Hicham Sabbah and Tarek Mahla, all members of Al-Adl wal-Ihsan, were reported to have been tortured and otherwise ill-treated by National Brigade of the Judicial Police officers over three days following their arrest on 28 June. At least five of the seven alleged that they had been raped. No investigation was known to have been conducted by the authorities. The seven were held incommunicado for longer than the maximum allowed by law, during which they said they were forced to sign incriminating statements under torture. They were charged with kidnapping and assaulting a former member of Al-Adl wal-Ihsan. On 21 December, all of the defendants were acquitted and released. The former member of Al-Adl wal-Ihsan appealed against the acquittals. 
Fodail Aberkane was reported to have died on 18
September as a result of internal bleeding caused when he was beaten by a group of seven or eight police officers at Salé police station. His family lodged a complaint. An investigation led to the arrest of several policemen believed to be responsible.
========== MOZAMBIQUE ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
There were reports of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons. In April, at least seven inmates at the Brigada Operacional’s Maximum Security
Prison in Maputo told the Justice Minister during her visit to the prison that they had been beaten, kicked, whipped and tied up by prison guards. One reported that the guards had allowed other inmates to beat him and had joined in the beatings. Five of the prisoners were apparently ill-treated as a disciplinary measure for being in possession of mobile phones; another was ill-treated for returning late to his cell, while the seventh was not aware of the reason for this treatment. The Director of the prison and other prison guards were suspended but no information was available regarding criminal proceedings against them by the end of the year.

On 25 May, Sanu Sunar, a Dalit aged 46, died from injuries sustained in police custody at the Kalimati
Police Station after he was arrested for theft. The NHRC said Sanu Sunar died as a result of police torture and recommended legal action. On 24 June, the

Anti-Torture Policy. No further action was taken.
Detainees were regularly held by the police for longer than the constitutionally guaranteed 48 hours before being brought before a judge, often for weeks and even months. 
Shete Obusoh and Chijioke Olemeforo were arrested by police officers from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad on 4 October and spent 17 days in police detention before being taken to court and remanded in prison on246

On 1 March, two men accused of robbery were filmed being held down and whipped by police in a police station in Chiniot city, Punjab province. Following broadcast of the film on national television, five police officers were arrested. Their cases were pending. 
On 15 August, two brothers accused of robbery, 17- year-old Hafiz Mohammad Mughees Sajjad and
Mohammad Muneeb Sajjad, aged 15, were beaten to death by a mob in Sialkot city, Punjab. The incident was caught on film. A judicial inquiry found that the boys had been innocent of the charges and that police officers present at the scene of the lynching had failed to stop the attack.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees by security and police forces were reported – by the PA’s
Preventive Security force and the General Intelligence
Service in the West Bank; and by Internal Security in
Gaza. The ICHR said it had received over 150 complaints of torture or other ill-treatment by the PA in the West Bank and over 200 by Hamas in Gaza.
New reports emerged of cases from 2009. 
In both areas, torture and other ill-treatment were committed with impunity. In a rare prosecution, five members of the PA’s General Intelligence Service were tried during 2010 in connection with the death in custody of Haitham Amr in June 2009, but were acquitted by a military court. 
Mohammed Baraka Abdel-Aziz Abu-Moailek was reported to have been tortured by Internal Security officials in Gaza. He was held incommunicado for more than 50 days after his arrest in April 2009 on suspicion of “collaboration” with Israel. He said he was tortured with electric shocks, beaten on the soles of his feet (the falaqa method), burned with cigarettes and threatened with death to force him to confess. He remained on trial and in detention at the end of 2010. 
Ahmed Salhab, a mechanic, was reported to have been tortured following arrest in September by PA security officials, allegedly for suspected association with Hamas. He said he was tied tightly in stress positions for long periods (the shabeh method). This exacerbated a serious back injury caused by previous torture by PA security officials. He was released without charge in October.
One death in custody following an assault by police was reported in Gaza. 
Nazira Jaddou’a al-Sweirki died on 1 January shortly after she was hit on the back and otherwise assaulted by police in Gaza. Three of her adult sons were beaten and two were detained on suspicion of supporting Fatah.

In February, police refused to investigate allegations that members of the police mobile squad had beaten and forcibly evicted people living near the Porgera mine area in 2009.
In May, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture found that torture and other ill-treatment were widespread in prisons and police stations. Detainees who tried to escape were often brutally beaten with bush knives and gun butts; some were shot at close range, or had their tendons cut with axes and bush knives. Police often punished detainees by beating them, and many juveniles were held with adult prisoners. 
In September in the Northern Province, a policeman who apprehended a robbery suspect shot him in the leg and left him to bleed until another policeman helped the man to hospital. 
In October, a policeman who had been drinking alcohol killed a 15-year-old boy being held in a police cell by opening fire at him at point-blank range. 
In November, prison wardens shot dead five prisoners trying to escape from jail. Another five prisoners were wounded during the shooting.

In August, Philippine media broadcast a video of a plain-clothes police officer in a Manila police station torturing Darius Evangelista, a suspect apparently held for petty theft, while uniformed police officers looked on.
The footage showed the suspect naked, being yanked by a cord attached to his genitals and whipped with a rope. The video prompted the authorities to suspend all11 police officers involved. Darius Evangelista was arrested by policemen in March, but has not been seen since. There were no records of his arrest in the police logs. Darius Evangelista’s wife filed a formal complaint against nine police officers stating that his case was a violation of the Anti-Torture Act of 2009. 
In January, 40-year-old Ambrosio Derejeno was reportedly subjected to enforced disappearance. A family member last saw him in the custody of CAFGU members in Samar province. He was tied up and surrounded by men in camouflage uniform pointing their guns at him. Under the Anti-Torture Act of 2009, the act of using firearms to threaten someone who is restrained constitutes torture.
In December, the President signed the
Implementing Rules and regulations for the Anti-

Leonor Cipriano’s appeal against the ruling by the
Criminal Court of Faro to acquit the three police officers involved in her detention in 2004 was still pending. The
Court had found on 22 May 2009 that she had been tortured in police custody, but claimed it was not able to identify those responsible. 
Hearings in the trial of three judicial police officers accused of torturing Virgolino Borges in police custody in March 2000 were scheduled but then postponed until the end of the year. The investigation had been closed in 2005 by the Criminal Investigating Court on the grounds that the injuries could have been self- inflicted. Virgolino Borges challenged this decision and in November 2005 the Appeals Court (Tribunal da
Relação) ordered the case to go to court.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Concerns of inadequate implementation of the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment persisted, in particular with regard to the failure to prohibit the use of evidence gathered under torture or other ill- treatment in the criminal code, despite amendments in May.
In August, the CERD Committee noted excessive use of force and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials against minorities, and Roma in particular.
Local NGOs also expressed concerns about continuing reports of torture and other ill-treatment in detention, and an ongoing climate of impunity in some cases. 
In June, the European Court of Human Rights found
Romania in breach of the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment in the case of Dragoş Ciupercescu represented by the Romanian Helsinki Committee(APADOR-CH). In 2003 while in pre-trial detention,
Dragoş Ciupercescu had been subjected to strip- searches carried out by masked wardens, and held in a nine-bed cell together with 19 other prisoners where each of them had 0.75m2 of living space. 
In July, the European Court of Human Rights held that Romania had violated the prohibition of torture and failed to carry out an effective investigation into a death, thereby also violating the right to a remedy. The case involved Gabriel Carabulea, a Romani man who died in police custody in May 1996. In an investigation into the case, the military prosecutor had determined in1998 that the man had died of heart disease. The
European Court concluded that his death resulted from a blunt force trauma which he suffered after the arrest and that the injuries appeared to have been inflicted upon him intentionally.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials, often allegedly with the purpose of extracting confessions or money, remained widespread. Corruption and collusion between the police, investigators and prosecutors were widely perceived as undermining the effectiveness of investigations and obstructing prosecutions. Detainees frequently reported unlawful disciplinary punishments and the denial of necessary medical care. 
On the night of 31 August, 17-year-old Nikita Kaftasyev and a friend were stopped by the police in Kstovo in the
Nizhnii Novgorod region. Nikita Kaftasyev alleged that he and his friend were beaten by the police. They were held overnight at the police station, where the beatings continued. Nikita Kaftasyev suffered serious injuries to his genitals. The next morning he reported that the police took him home, and then tried to make his mother sign a statement that she had no claims against the police.270

Torture and other ill-treatment
The authorities maintained a high degree of secrecy about detainees and their detention conditions  and treatment, but reports emerged of at least two deaths in custody, possibly as a result of torture or other ill-treatment. 
Dr Muhammad Amin al-Namrat, a Jordanian, died in
January in the General Intelligence prison in ‘Asir province. An Arabic teacher, he was reported to have been sentenced to two years in prison in 2007 for urging his students to take up arms against US forces in
Iraq. He appeared to have been detained beyond the expiry of his sentence. No official investigation into his death was reported. 
Mohammed Farhan died in September while detained at a police station in Jubail. A medical report was said to have referred to marks of strangulation on his neck. No investigation into his death was reported to have taken place by the end of the year.  
A former detainee who had been held in Riyadh’s‘Ulaysha prison as a security suspect in 2007 and2008 told Amnesty International that he had been kept handcuffed and shackled for 27 days following his arrest before the handcuffs were removed and he was allowed to take a shower for the first time. He said that he had been interrogated during the night for more than a month and that this was routine for security suspects.
========== SENEGAL ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The police regularly tortured suspects. 
In July, Abdoulaye Wade Yinghou, aged 29, was arrested as he walked past a demonstration in a Dakar suburb. Witnesses saw police beat him with rifle butts during his arrest and at the police station. The following day, his family were told by police officers that he had died following a seizure or illness. An autopsy revealed facial injuries and broken ribs. An inquiry was opened but its findings had not been made public by the end of the year.
========== SERBIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
The European Commission expressed concern  about continued impunity for torture and other ill-treatment in November. Serbia had not established a National Preventive Mechanism as required by the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against
Torture, nor adopted a 2009 by-law on the internal oversight of prisons. 
The Požarevac Public Prosecutor rejected a complaint by “JD”, that he was tortured by five guards at Zabela prison on 18 May; the incident had been recorded by surveillance cameras. 
Five Leskovac prison staff, arrested in November2009 on suspicion of abusing and torturing detainees, returned to work in 2010. In November, in the absence of a response from the prosecutor, the Leskovac
Committee for Human Rights filed a complaint to the
Constitutional Court on behalf of “DB”, who alleged that his arm had been broken by prison guards.

The first Belgrade Pride since 2001 took place in
October. More than 5,000 police officers were deployed to protect 1,000 Pride participants from around 6,500 counter-demonstrators, who attacked the police and political party offices and caused more than a million euros’ worth of damage. Some 124 police officers were injured by counter-demonstrators, of whom 249 were arrested, and 131 detained for further questioning under a hastily amended article of the Criminal Code increasing the period of detention from eight to 30 days. In December, 83 people were charged with causing violence. No one was arrested for attacks on activists which had taken place before and after the march.
Torture and other ill-treatment
The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited places of detention in Kosovo in June. In the same month several Vetëvendosje! activists were ill- treated and some hospitalized during a police operation to arrest Albin Kurti (see Justice system, above). The Kosovo Centre for the Rehabilitation of
Torture Victims reported some improvements in prison conditions, but noted that prisoners alleged that corruption among prison staff often led to unfair disciplinary measures.
Inter-ethnic violence
Violent incidents between Kosovo Serbs and  ethnic Albanians continued in the predominantly
In May, the Kosovo Police used tear gas to separate
Serbs and Albanians during a protest by ethnic
Albanians against the participation of Kosovo Serbs in
Serbian local elections. On 2 July, 1,500 Serbs protested against the opening of a civil registration office in Bosnjačka Mahala, an ethnically mixed area of north Mitrovica/ë. An explosive device killed a
Bosniak paediatrician and 11 Serbian protesters were injured. On 5 July, a Kosovo-Serb member of the
Kosovo Assembly was shot and wounded in both legs in front of his house in north Mitrovica/ë.
Tension increased following the ICJ ruling on
Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence. In
September, ethnic Albanians in north Mitrovica/ë requested additional police protection following several grenade attacks and the killing of Hakif
Mehmeti on 7 September. A Serbian Kosovo Police officer was arrested three days later. On 12
September, Kosovo Force (KFOR) troops and EULEX police were deployed following Turkey’s victory over
Serbia in basketball, and Albanians from south
Mitrovica/ë clashed with Serbs on the bridge over the river Ibar, separating the Serb and Albanian parts of the town. Two KFOR officers, a police officer and five civilians were injured. In the same month an ethnic Albanian baker in Zvečan was physically attacked three times, and his shop damaged by an explosive device.
Accountability
In March, the Human Rights Advisory Panel declared inadmissible a complaint by the families of Mon Balaj and Arben Xheladini, killed by Romanian police, and by
Zenel Zeneli and Mustafë Nerjovaj who were seriously injured, during a demonstration on 10 February 2007.
The Panel’s decision followed a 2009 Administrative
Directive issued by UNMIK which effectively rendered inadmissible applications by plaintiffs who had been offered financial compensation under a UN third party claims process.
On similar grounds, the Panel declared inadmissible a complaint by 143 internally displaced Roma and
Ashkali residents of UNMIK-administered camps in northern Mitrovicë/a that they had suffered lead poisoning and other health problems due to contamination of the camps where they had lived since 1999. Their third-party claim against the UN had been pending since February 2006. 
The Panel continued to consider complaints against
UNMIK for failing to investigate the post-war abduction of Serbs.

In November, the District Court in Košice held the first hearing in the case of the ill-treatment by police of six Romani boys in April 2009. The Prosecutor General charged 10 police officers with abuse of powers, including racial motivation. Four of the accused police officers faced charges of lack of due diligence, as they allegedly witnessed the abuse without intervening. All of the accused police officers reportedly pleaded not guilty and refused to testify at the court hearing. Three of them continued to work for the police.

========== SOLOMON ISLANDS ==========
========== SOMALIA ==========
========== SOUTH AFRICA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Incidents of torture and other ill-treatment by police of detained crime suspects were reported.
The police oversight body, the Independent
Complaints Directorate (ICD), reported that from April2009 to March 2010 it had received five direct complaints of torture and 920 complaints of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, some of which were being investigated for evidence of torture.
Seven of the 294 deaths in custody were linked to torture and 90 others to “injuries sustained in custody”. The ICD also investigated 24 complaints of rape by police officers.
A draft law establishing the ICD on an independent statutory basis, separate from police legislation, was still being considered by Parliament at the end of the year. In parliamentary hearings in August, CSOs called for the inclusion of explicit obligations to investigate complaints of torture and rape in custody and for mandatory reporting by police with knowledge of these offences. Their recommendations were included in a revised bill.
Despite continuing efforts by the South African
Human Rights Commission and CSOs, South Africa did not ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. A new version of the draft law to make torture a criminal offence was circulated for comment, but had not been presented in Parliament before the end of the year. 
In May, a police officer, Vinod Maharaj, was arrested and allegedly tortured by members of the Organized
Crime Unit and the special police unit, the Hawks. He was allegedly subjected to electric shocks, beatings, removal of a fingernail and suffocation torture. Four days after his arrest he was brought to court on weapons and murder charges. Although the court ordered the police to ensure his access to medical treatment, he was denied this. Four days later he was taken to hospital for emergency surgery. He was in remand custody with no trial date set at the end of the year. 
In June, a lawyer consulting with his client at Protea
Police Station in Soweto heard screaming from an adjacent office where a man was apparently being electrocuted. When he attempted to persuade police officers to intervene, he was verbally abused, threatened with violence and told to leave the police station. Lawyers managed later to trace the man who was being tortured and a second detainee who had also been assaulted; they were being held under police guard in Leratong Hospital. Access to them was denied. Four days later they were removed from hospital by members of the Organized Crime Unit and allegedly subjected to further torture, before being transferred to remand custody on murder and robbery charges. One was later released.  
Three suspected illegal immigrants arrested near the border with Lesotho were detained and assaulted at
Ladybrand police station. On 14 June, their lawyer observed that they had facial injuries and blood on their clothes and one required urgent medical attention. The following day immigration officials authorized their release. When they attempted to complain of assault by the police, the lawyer and one of the detainees were verbally abused, pushed and threatened with violence by a police officer at the station. When the lawyer attempted to obtain the medico-legal reporting form, the same officer allegedly assaulted him repeatedly and forced him out of the police station. In September the
Director of Public Prosecutions decided to prosecute two police officers on assault charges, following a prompt ICD investigation into the allegations. 
Following an ICD investigation and police disciplinary hearing, the station commander of Sasolburg police station was dismissed from service for raping a woman volunteer in his office on 5 February. His criminal trial had not concluded by the end of the year.
The Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services received over 2,000 complaints of assaults against prisoners by prison warders between April 2009 and
March 2010. Overcrowding remained a serious problem, with 19 of 239 facilities having occupancy rates of over 200 per cent capacity and conditions described as “shockingly inhumane”.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued. No measures were taken to compile and publish data on cases which may have involved violations of the human rights of people in police custody, as provided by the Human
Rights Action Plan adopted by the government in 2008.
In June, the reform of the criminal code did not amend the definition of torture, despite recommendations by the UN Committee against
Torture to bring it in line with international human rights standards. The criminal code continued to distinguish between “serious” infringements of the article prohibiting torture and infringements “which are not”. 
The trial of two police officers charged with killing
Osamuyia Akpitaye while he was being forcibly deported from Spain in June 2007 was set for 16 and17 March 2011.
========== SRI LANKA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Police and army personnel continued to torture or otherwise ill-treat detainees. Victims included detained Tamils suspected of links to the LTTE and individuals arrested for suspected “ordinary” criminal offences. Some people died in custody after being tortured by police. 
In videotaped testimony made available by
Janasansadaya, a Sri Lankan NGO, Samarasinghe
Pushpakumara said he was detained on 10 November and tortured by Beruwala police after an officer pretended to hire him as a driver and then arrested him for burglary. Samarasinghe Pushpakumara said he was assaulted, threatened with criminal charges for possession of drugs or bombs, and told he could be killed. He was blindfolded and tied to a bed for two days before police released him without charge, but with a warning to keep silent about his treatment.

========== SWEDEN ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Sweden refused to exclude reliance on “diplomatic assurances” to facilitate the deportation of individuals to countries where they might face torture or other ill- treatment, and continued to fail to introduce torture as a crime in its penal code. 
Ahmed Agiza remained in prison in Egypt following an unfair trial by a military court, and concerns remained about his deteriorating physical health.
Sweden continued to fail to fully investigate the renditions of Ahmed Agiza and Mohammed El Zari on a
CIA-leased plane from Sweden to Egypt in December2001, where the two men alleged they were tortured and ill-treated in Egyptian custody. Although the men received monetary compensation, Sweden has failed to provide them with full, effective redress. 
Two further investigations into the death of Johan
Liljeqvist, a 24-year-old man who died in April 2008 following his arrest by the police in Gothenburg, were closed in March and November respectively, despite medical evidence indicating that his death was“connected to the intervention of the police”.
In December, a report examining police investigations into cases of death in police custody, initiated following the Liljeqvist case, was released.
The report heavily criticized the adequacy of police investigations in such cases and recommended immediate changes to improve their independence, impartiality and thoroughness.

========== SYRIA ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were used extensively and with impunity in police stations and security agencies’ detention centres. According to reports, suspected Islamists and members of the Kurdish minority were subject to particularly harsh abuse. The
SSSC and other courts often convicted defendants on the basis of “confessions” alleged to have been extracted under torture or other duress. ‘Abdelbaqi Khalaf, a Syrian Kurdish pro-democracy activist detained in September 2008, was reported to have been shackled by his wrists to a wall for eight days, tortured and otherwise ill-treated during more than a year in incommunicado detention. In August2010 it was reported that he was being tortured to force him to “confess” to killing two members of the security forces. He was held at ‘Adra prison.
In May, the UN Committee against Torture expressed concern about “numerous, ongoing and consistent” reports of torture by law enforcement and investigative officials, at their instigation or with their consent, particularly in detention facilities, and criticized the “quasi permanent” status of state of emergency legislation which “allows the suspension of fundamental rights and freedoms”. The government did not respond and had not implemented any of the Committee’s many recommendations by the end of 2010.

Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued reports of torture and other ill- treatment by law enforcement officers. The common police practice of incommunicado detention before formally opening a criminal case increased the risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Confessions extracted under duress continued to be used as evidence in courts. Victims rarely reported physical abuse by law enforcement officers for fear of repercussions, and impunity remained the rule. Tajikistani human rights groups, lawyers and judges called on the government to include a precise definition of torture, in line with international standards, in national legislation. 
On 26 February, Nematillo Botakozuev, a
Kyrgyzstani human rights defender, was detained by police in the Tajikistani capital, Dushanbe, after he had visited the office of the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, to apply for refugee status. He was wanted by the Kyrgyzstani authorities for his alleged involvement in a demonstration in the town of Nookat in 2008. He was held incommunicado for almost a month and reportedly tortured at the premises of the State
Committee for National Security. He was also reportedly denied appropriate medical treatment. On22 May he was extradited to Kyrgyzstan and released by a court in the city of Osh. 
Ilhom Ismonov was detained on 3 November in
Khujand in Soghd region and charged with “organizing a criminal group”. He was not brought before a judge until nine days later on 12 November, in contravention of the Tajikistani Criminal Procedure Code, which states that detainees must be brought before a judge to rule on their continued detention no later than 72 hours after their arrest. He was also denied access to his lawyer until he appeared in court. He reportedly told the judge that he had been given electric shocks and had boiling water poured over his body while held at the
Department for the Fight against Organized Crime (6th
Department) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in
Khujand. The judge reportedly did not address the torture allegations. In December, the Prosecutor’s office of Soghd region informed Ilhom Ismonov’s wife and lawyer that its examination of the case had shown that the allegations of torture were false, that he had not been unlawfully detained, and that there had been no problem with his access to a lawyer. No details were given on how the examination was conducted.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment persisted, especially outside places of detention, including during demonstrations, but also in police custody and during transfer to prison. In November, the UN
Committee against Torture issued a series of recommendations to the authorities to combat“numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations of torture” for which the Committee expressed grave concern during their review of Turkey. 
In January, Murat Konuş died after being held in police custody in Istanbul on suspicion of aggravated theft. Video camera footage showed him entering the police station in good health and being carried out three hours later. An official autopsy recorded injuries to his body and found that his death was due to cerebral bleeding. In May seven police officers were charged with causing his death through torture. The trial was ongoing at the end of the year. 
In June, a landmark judgement saw 19 officials, including police officers and prison guards convicted for their part in the torture that resulted in the death of political activist Engin Çeber in Istanbul in October2008. Of those convicted, three prison guards and a prison manager were sentenced to life imprisonment328 
following an investigation and prosecution that contrasted starkly with other cases involving alleged torture committed by state officials. The convictions remained pending at the Supreme Court of Appeals at the end of the year.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations continued of torture and other ill-treatment in police custody. In March, the Human Rights
Department within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which had monitored police detention, was closed. It was replaced with a smaller division without a monitoring remit.
On 1 July, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a group of prisoners had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment when they were beaten in Zamkova Prison in Khmelnitskiy region in two separate incidents in 2001 and 2002. The beatings took place during a training programme for the Rapid
Reaction Unit, a special group of prison guards called in to deal with unrest in prisons. 
On 1 July, prisoners in Vinnytsya Remand Prison 
No. 1 were reportedly ill-treated by the Rapid Reaction
Unit as punishment for protesting against the ill- treatment of a group of prisoners the day before.
Prisoners’ relatives gave accounts of the events over the two days. On 30 June a group of 15 prisoners were due to be taken to court. The police officers escorting them ordered one of them to strip naked. When he refused to remove his underpants, he was beaten, handcuffed and tied to the wall. Other prisoners were also beaten.
When the police convoy arrived to escort prisoners to court the next day, the prisoners refused to leave their cells in protest at the previous beatings. The prison authorities called in the Rapid Reaction Unit, which allegedly beat prisoners indiscriminately.

Torture and other ill-treatment
In January, a court in Abu Dhabi acquitted Sheikh
Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan of assault and rape-related charges in connection with a 2004 attack on an
under the influence of drugs administered by associates who wished to film and then blackmail him.
In April, 17 Indian men who had been sentenced to death in March by a lower court in Sharjah told journalists that they had been ill-treated following their arrest in January 2009. No investigation into their allegations was known to have been carried out.
========== UNITED KINGDOM ==========
Torture and other ill-treatment
In July, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of an inquiry into UK involvement in the alleged mistreatment of individuals detained abroad by foreign intelligence services, in the context of counter-terrorism operations. The three-person inquiry panel, to be led by the Intelligence Services
Commissioner, should begin its work in 2011. Civil society and human rights organizations raised concerns about whether the inquiry would have adequate powers and be sufficiently independent.
On the same date the government published the guidelines issued to intelligence officers and service personnel on the detention and interrogation of detainees overseas, and for sharing intelligence relating to detainees. Human rights organizations stated that the guidance was not compatible with international human rights standards.
In July, the High Court ordered the disclosure of a number of previously secret documents relating to the detention of UK nationals and residents in the custody of US and other overseas intelligence agencies. The documents provided further evidence of UK involvement in and knowledge of human rights violations, up to the highest levels of government.
In November, the Justice Secretary announced financial payments to 16 UK nationals or residents as part of a mediated settlement of civil damages claims brought by individuals detained in Guantánamo Bay.
The terms of the settlement remained confidential.  
On 10 February, the Court of Appeal ordered the disclosure of seven previously redacted paragraphs concerning the treatment in US custody of former
Guantánamo detainee Binyam Mohamed. The disclosed paragraphs reaffirmed that UK intelligence officers knew that Binyam Mohamed was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in US custody. On17 November, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute a UK security services officer for any criminal offence arising from an interview conducted with
Binyam Mohamed while in detention in Pakistan on 17
May 2002.
Wider investigations into allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the UK security services remained open at the end of the year, including in relation to the case of former UK resident Shaker Aamer. At the end of the year he remained detained without charge in
Guantánamo Bay, despite public confirmation by the338 
UK authorities that they would accept him.
Legal and policy developments
On 12 January, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that powers, under Section 44 of the Terrorism
Act 2000, permitting the police to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion were unlawful, as they violate the right to respect for private life. The government subsequently announced that individuals would no longer be searched under these powers. 
In July, the Home Office announced a “rapid review” of six key counter-terrorism powers: control orders; stop and search powers under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000; the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000 and access to communications data; deportations with assurances; measures to deal with organizations that promote hatred or violence; and the pre-charge detention of terrorist suspects. 
In April, the government announced that Lotfi Raissi, wrongly alleged to have participated in the attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001, was eligible for compensation, eight years after the courts found that there was “no evidence whatsoever” to support the allegations.“Control Orders”
As of 10 December, eight individuals, all British nationals, were under “control orders”. The control order regime, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act2005, allows a government minister, subject to limited judicial scrutiny, to impose severe restrictions on an individual who is suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity. The regime was renewed by
Parliament in March 2010 for one more year. 
In June, the Supreme Court issued its judgement in the case of “AP”, ruling that the term of his control order requiring him to live in a city some 150 miles away from his family, when taken together with the 16- hour curfew restriction and the resultant social isolation, constituted a deprivation of his right to liberty.
The High Court reinforced the importance of family rights in September when it ruled that the forced relocation of “CA” could not be justified as it disproportionately affected his right to family life. 
On 26 July, the High Court ruled that the government could rely on the same material to impose a control order against “AY” as had been used in a previously unsuccessful prosecution.
Deportations
There were continued attempts to deport individuals alleged to pose a threat to “national security” to countries where they would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. In May, the new government stated that it would maintain and extend the use of“diplomatic assurances”, arguing they were sufficient to mitigate the risk of torture.
Proceedings by which these deportations could be challenged before the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission (SIAC) remained unfair. In particular, they relied on secret material undisclosed to the individuals concerned or the lawyer of their choice. 
Despite the SIAC determining in 2007 that Mouloud
Sihali, an Algerian national, was not a risk to national security, the government continued to seek his deportation to Algeria. In March, the SIAC dismissed his appeal against his deportation, concluding that diplomatic assurances negotiated between the UK and
Algeria would be sufficient to mitigate any risk he may face upon his return. The case was pending before the
Court of Appeal at the end of the year. 
In May, the SIAC ruled that the UK could not proceed with deportation in the case of two Pakistani nationals to Pakistan, due to the risk that they would be subject to torture or other ill-treatment on return. It further held that confidential assurances could not be accepted as a sufficient safeguard to mitigate that risk. 
The first challenge to the Memorandum of
Understanding negotiated between the Ethiopian and UK governments failed. In September, the SIAC ruled that“XX”, an Ethiopian national who argued that he would be at risk of torture if returned, could be sent back to Ethiopia relying on assurances of humane treatment from the
Ethiopian government. The decision was to be appealed.

Torture and other ill-treatment
Despite assertions by the authorities that the practice of torture had significantly decreased, reports of torture or other ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners continued unabated. In most cases, the authorities failed to conduct prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into these allegations.
Several thousand people convicted of involvement with Islamist parties or Islamic movements banned in
Uzbekistan, as well as government critics and political opponents, continued to serve long prison terms under conditions that amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
Uzbekistan again refused to allow the UN Special
Rapporteur on torture to visit the country despite renewed requests. 
In June, the authorities released opposition politician Sanzhar Umarov on humanitarian grounds and allowed him to rejoin his family in the USA.
Sanzhar Umarov had been sentenced to eight years in prison in 2006 on charges of fraud and embezzlement after an unfair trial. His supporters claimed the charges were politically motivated. In
 The European Court of Human Rights ruled on 10
June in the case Garayev v. Azerbaijan that the extradition of Shaig Garayev from Azerbaijan to
Uzbekistan would violate the prohibition of torture under the European Convention on Human Rights. The court stated that “any criminal suspect held in custody[in Uzbekistan] faces a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment”.
