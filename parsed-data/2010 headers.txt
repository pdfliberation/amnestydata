In a troubled and divided world, Amnesty International reveals truth, bears witness and campaigns for change.
For every human rights abuse Amnesty International exposes, it demands accountability. In 2009 this led our members and supporters to push for robust international and national laws and to insist that these laws must be used to bring about real justice.
The Amnesty International Report 2010 documents the state of human rights in 159 countries in 2009. It details a year in which accountability seemed a remote ideal for many, as people’s lives continued to be torn apart by repression, violence, discrimination, power plays and political stalemates.
But the report also celebrates real progress. It reveals how it is harder now for perpetrators of the worst crimes to secure impunity. It argues that the demand for accountability is not confined to redress for killings or torture, but extends to the denial of all the rights that we need to live our lives in dignity.
This report also records the courage, imagination and determination of the worldwide human rights movement.

In a troubled and divided world, Amnesty International reveals truth, bears witness and campaigns for change.
For every human rights abuse Amnesty International exposes, it demands accountability. In 2009 this led our members and supporters to push for robust international and national laws and to insist that these laws must be used to bring about real justice.
The Amnesty International Report 2010 documents the state of human rights in 159 countries in 2009. It details a year in which accountability seemed a remote ideal for many, as people’s lives continued to be torn apart by repression, violence, discrimination, power plays and political stalemates.
But the report also celebrates real progress. It reveals how it is harder now for perpetrators of the worst crimes to secure impunity. It argues that the demand for accountability is not confined to redress for killings or torture, but extends to the denial of all the rights that we need to live our lives in dignity.
This report also records the courage, imagination and determination of the worldwide human rights movement.
