Torture and other ill-treatment
In February, mobile phone images of the torture in 2010 of two prisoners by prison guards in San
Felipe prison, Mendoza province, came to light.
Prisoners Matías Tello and Andrés Yacante, who were suspected by prison officers of involvement in circulating the images, received threats and were transferred to Almafuerte prison where they alleged that they were tortured. By the end of the year nobody had been brought to justice.
