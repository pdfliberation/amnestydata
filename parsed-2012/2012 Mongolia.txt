Torture and other ill-treatment
The government passed a resolution in May on the implementation of recommendations issued by UN treaty bodies. This included plans to amend the
Criminal Code to define torture as a crime in line with the UN Convention against Torture. The working group, established under the Ministry of Justice and
Home Affairs in 2010 to draft amendments to the
Criminal Code, appeared to make little progress.
The pre-trial detention facility 461, which opened in early 2011, had installed video cameras in interrogation rooms but there were insufficient safeguards or procedures in place to monitor and prevent misuse of this equipment. 
A working group, set up in June 2010 by the
Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights, continued to investigate allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of Enkhbat Damiran and his lawyer.
Enkhbat Damiran was kidnapped in France in 2003 and brought to Mongolia where he was charged with the murder of Zorig Sanjaasuren, a prominent pro- democracy activist and politician. Enkhbat Damiran claimed he was tortured while in detention. He died in2007. 
His lawyer, Lodoisambuu Sanjaasuren (no relation to the victim), was also arrested and convicted of exposing state secrets.
