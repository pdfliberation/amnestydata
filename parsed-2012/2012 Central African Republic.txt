Torture and other ill-treatment
Members of the security forces were accused of torture; the government took no action against those accused of torture in previous years. 
In August, a supermarket worker in the capital, Bangui, who had been accused of theft, was severely beaten and had his right arm broken by members of the Central
African Office for the Repression of Banditry in Bangui.
