Torture and other ill-treatment
Sweden failed again to introduce torture as a crime in its Penal Code. 
On 2 August, Ahmed Agiza was released from prison in Cairo, Egypt, having been held for over nine years following an unfair trial before a military court. Ahmed
Agiza and Mohammed al-Zari, both Egyptian asylum- seekers, were detained in Sweden in December 2001 and subjected to rendition from Sweden to Egypt on a
CIA-leased plane. Both men subsequently reported that they had been tortured and ill-treated while being held incommunicado in Egypt. In 2008, the Swedish government awarded both men financial compensation for the human rights violations they had suffered.
However, an effective, impartial, thorough and independent investigation into these violations remained outstanding.322 
Following his release, Ahmed Agiza applied for a residence permit in Sweden in order to be reunited with his family who still lived there. Awarding him a residence permit would help to ensure that he received full and effective redress for the violations he had suffered.
