Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continued reports of torture or other ill- treatment of human rights defenders, journalists, and certain religious minorities by police, officers of the
Ministry of National Security and prison personnel.
The authorities failed to carry out effective investigations into such allegations.
In June the Committee against Torture published its Concluding Observations on Turkmenistan. The
Committee expressed concern at the “numerous and consistent allegations about the widespread practice of torture and ill-treatment of detainees”.
