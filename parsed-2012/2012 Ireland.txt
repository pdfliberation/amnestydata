Torture and other ill-treatment
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, including of children, continued to be reported. Among the most commonly cited methods were beatings, threats to the detainee or their family, sleep deprivation, and being shackled in painful positions for long periods.
Confessions allegedly obtained under duress were accepted as evidence in Israeli military courts. 
Islam Dar Ayyoub, aged 14, was arrested at his home in the West Bank village of al-Nabi Saleh at around 2am on 23 January. Blindfolded and handcuffed, he was transferred by military jeep via the nearby settlement of
Halamish to the police station in the settlement of
Ma’ale Adumim, where he was interrogated for hours without the presence of a lawyer; he was not allowed to rest, eat, or go to the toilet. Information obtained from him during interrogation was used to incriminate al-
Nabi Saleh protest organizer Bassem Tamimi (see below). 
In February, Gazan engineer Dirar Abu Sisi was forcibly transferred to Israel from Ukraine and held at
Shikma Prison, near Ashkelon, where he was denied188 
access to a lawyer for 25 days. In April, he was charged with developing rockets for Hamas’ military wing; the
Israeli authorities said he had confessed but his lawyers alleged that his confession had been obtained under torture. He was still held, reportedly in solitary confinement, at the end of the year.
