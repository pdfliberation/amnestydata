Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment of detainees by the security forces. The most commonly reported methods were beatings, electric shocks, burning with cigarettes and suspension by the limbs, often for long periods. 
In February, detainees at the Political Security prison in Sana’a, including alleged al-Qa’ida members or supporters, were reported to have been beaten by guards and held in solitary confinement after going on hunger strike to protest against their prolonged detention without charge or trial, ill-treatment and denial of adequate medical care. At least 10 detainees were said to have required hospital treatment as a result of the beatings. 
Mustafa Abdu Yahya al-Nahari was reported to have been repeatedly kicked, beaten, and whipped by
Central Security officials, who held him at an unknown place for a week after they arrested him at his home on14 
November. He was kept blindfolded throughout, interrogated about the protests and made to sign a document without knowing what it contained, then released by being left, still blindfolded, in a street.
