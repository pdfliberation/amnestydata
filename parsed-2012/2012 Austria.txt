Torture and other ill-treatment
Austria failed to introduce the crime of torture into its criminal code despite repeated recommendations by the UN Committee against Torture. 
Gambian citizen Bakary J., who was tortured by four police officers in 2006 following an unsuccessful deportation, had still not received reparation and was at risk of deportation. His complaint before the European
Court of Human Rights was still pending. 
In January, the police officer who in February 2009 injured US citizen Mike B., an African-American teacher, during a plain-clothes police operation in
Vienna, was sentenced to a fine for grievous bodily harm by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court. In68 
September, the fine was reduced by the Austrian
Supreme Court.
