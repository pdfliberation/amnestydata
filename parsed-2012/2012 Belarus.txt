Torture and other ill-treatment
There was no independent system of monitoring places of detention. Complaints against law enforcement officers were usually rejected by prosecutors, and those who complained faced reprisals from police. 
On 28 February, after being released on bail,
Alyaksei Mihalevich, a presidential candidate charged with organizing a demonstration in Minsk on 19
December 2010, held a press conference. He alleged that he and other detainees had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including being strip- searched up to six times a day, and being forced to stand in stress positions. 
Zmitser Dashkevich, who was sentenced to two yearsâ€™ hard labour on 24 March in connection with the demonstration in December 2010, was placed in solitary confinement eight times during the year.
Conditions in solitary confinement include being denied exercise, refused bedding and deprived of sleep. Prisoners are also prevented from lying or sitting on bunks during the day.
