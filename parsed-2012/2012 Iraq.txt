Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were widespread in prisons and detention centres, in particular those controlled by the Ministries of Interior and Defence.
Commonly reported methods were suspension by the limbs for long periods, beatings with cables and hosepipes, electric shocks, breaking of limbs, partial asphyxiation with plastic bags, and rape or threats of rape. Torture was used to extract information from detainees and “confessions” that could be used as evidence against them in courts. 
Abdel Jabbar Shaloub Hammadi, who helped organize anti-government protests, was arrested on24 
February in a Baghdad street by 30 armed police.
He was beaten, blindfolded and taken to a police building in Baghdad’s al-Baladiyat district. During the first five days he was held there, he alleges that he was suspended by his wrists with his legs and arms bound together, and had icy water thrown over him. He was released without charge on 8 March.
Torture and other ill-treatment
A number of pro-democracy activists, including members of opposition political parties, were detained and tortured and otherwise ill-treated. 
Sharwan Azad Faqi ‘Abdullah, who was arrested in
Erbil during the protests on 25 February, was detained for four days and tortured. He was repeatedly punched to force him to sign a “confession”, and still had visible injuries apparently caused by torture when Amnesty
International delegates saw him on 11 March in Erbil. 
In early December, scores of members of the
Kurdistan Islamic Union, an authorized Islamist party, were arrested in Dohuk and Zakho by Kurdish security forces. Many were released within days, but at least 14 were held for several weeks. Some were reported to have been tortured. The arrests took place immediately after attacks by Islamist protesters on shops selling alcohol and other businesses.
