Torture and other ill-treatment
Reports of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees, notably by the Directorate for Surveillance of the
Territory, persisted, with suspected Islamists and members of the 20 February Movement particularly targeted. Detainees continued to be held incommunicado, in some cases allegedly beyond the12  days permitted by law. 
On 16-17 May, prisoners convicted of terrorism- related offences held at Salé Prison rioted in protest against their unfair trials and the use of torture at the secret Témara detention centre. They clashed with guards, briefly holding several hostage, before the prison authorities used live ammunition to quell the riots. Several prisoners were injured. 
In late May, Moroccan/German national Mohamed
Hajib serving a 10-year prison term needed hospital treatment after he was severely beaten and threatened with rape by guards at Toulal Prison in Meknes, to where he had been moved after participating in the unrest at Salé Prison.
