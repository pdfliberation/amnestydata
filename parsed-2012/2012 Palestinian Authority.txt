Torture and other ill-treatment
Detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated, particularly by Preventive Security and the General
Intelligence Service in the West Bank, and by Internal
Security in Gaza, all of which were able to abuse detainees with impunity. The ICHR reported receiving over 120 such allegations in the West Bank and over100  in Gaza. Alleged methods included beatings, suspension by the wrists or ankles, and enforced standing or sitting in painful positions (shabeh) for long periods. The ICHR also received complaints of torture and other ill-treatment of suspects by police – over 50 in the West Bank and 100 in Gaza.
In Gaza, four people died in custody in suspicious circumstances. ‘Adel 
Razeq was reported to have died four days after he was arrested without a warrant on 14 April. The
Hamas authorities said his death was due to deterioration in his medical condition; his family said he had been in good health when arrested. Hamas said his death was being investigated; the outcome was not made public.266
