Torture and other ill-treatment
In April, the Ombudsman’s Office started functioning as a National Preventive Mechanism under the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against
Torture, but lacked the authority and resources to fulfil its mandate.
Impunity for ill-treatment by the police continued.
Prosecutors failed to effectively investigate allegations.
Reports of ill-treatment by the “Alpha” police unit continued.
Unlawful killings 
Martin Neskovski was severely beaten on 6 June during post-election celebrations in Skopje, and died of head wounds. Despite initial denials, Igor Spasov, a member of the “Tigers” anti-terrorist police unit was detained on 8 June. Repeated public protests questioned delays in the investigation and called for stricter civilian oversight of the police. Criminal proceedings in connection with the death opened in November.
