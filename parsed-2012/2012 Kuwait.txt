Torture and other ill-treatment
One man died in custody apparently after being tortured by police. 
Mohammad Ghazzai al-Maimuni al-Mutairi died after police arrested him in January for possessing alcohol. Initially, the authorities said he resisted arrest and died from a heart ailment but then launched an investigation after an opposition MP produced medical evidence indicating that he had been bound and severely beaten before he died. Some 19 police officers were charged in connection with his death; their trial was continuing.
The CAT urged the government to amend the law to make torture a crime punishable by severe penalties.
