Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture in pre-trial detention was widespread in order to extract confessions or implicate defendants. 
In March, Sow Bertin Agba was arrested for fraud and tortured while held in handcuffs for five days in a garage at the National Intelligence Agency premises.
He suffered a fractured arm and wounds all over his body. By the end of the year, he was still detained without trial at the civil prison in Tsévié. 
In September, 33 people accused of plotting against the State, including Kpatcha Gnassingbé, half-brother of the President, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 20 years by the Supreme Court. Immediately after the trial, the Minister of Justice asked the National
Commission on Human Rights to investigate the torture allegations. It had not published its conclusions by the end of the year.
