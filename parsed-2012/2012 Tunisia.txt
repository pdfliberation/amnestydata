Torture and other ill-treatment
There were new reports of torture and other ill- treatment but on a far reduced scale compared to previous years. In most cases, complainants alleged that they had been beaten by police when they were arrested during protests or while being taken to or detained at police stations. 
Fouad Badrouci, a student aged 17, was arrested by masked police officers in Tunis on 6 May after a protest.
They punched, kicked and beat him with batons before taking him with several other young protesters to
Bouchoucha Prison. There, the detainees were forced to stand with their arms and one leg raised for a prolonged period, beaten and denied food and water.
They were made to sign blank papers and were then released early the next day. Fouad Badrouci’s injuries included a broken nose, right arm and rib. 
Mohamed Sidki Hlimi alleged that he was raped and otherwise tortured by police officers who summoned him to an army camp in Kasserine in
March after he blamed a senior police officer for deaths during the protests against President Ben ‘Ali.
He said that he was handcuffed and shackled throughout his seven days of detention, and kept naked after the first night when he was stripped, suspended from a pole, beaten and raped. He was beaten again when he refused to sign a statement incriminating people he did not know in the burning of police stations. He was then released.
Following his visit to Tunisia in May, the UN Special
Rapporteur on torture urged the government to instruct all police and other law enforcement officials that torture and other ill-treatment are prohibited and to ensure that those who commit such abuses are held criminally liable.
