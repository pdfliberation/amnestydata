Torture and other ill-treatment
The police, the gendarmerie and members of the
National Security Agency (Agence Nationale de
Sécurité, ANS) regularly tortured suspects, sometimes with the involvement of local administrative authorities. 
On 20 September Guintar Abel, a civil servant at the
Ngondong sub-division in the Lac Wey department in southern Chad, died in hospital three weeks after being beaten by a local district chief and his bodyguards. At the end of the year, no action was known to have been taken.
