Torture and other ill-treatment
The police regularly tortured suspects; one reportedly died as a result. 
In April, the naked and handcuffed body of Aladji
Konat√©, bearing signs of torture, was found by a river in Bakel town. Security forces said he had jumped into the river to escape arrest for alleged drug trafficking. 
In September, three young men were ill-treated and wounded by gendarmes in the area of Thiaroye in
Dakar after being arrested following a complaint from a neighbour. An investigation was opened and two gendarmes were confined to their quarters. By the end of the year, the alleged perpetrators had not yet been tried and the victims had received no compensation.
