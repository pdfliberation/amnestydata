Torture and other ill-treatment
New reports were received of torture and other ill- treatment, a pattern of abuse that was believed to remain common with interrogators seeking to extract“confessions”  from suspects. 
A Shi’a detainee, whose identity is being withheld because of fears for his safety, told Amnesty
International that he was tortured for 10 days until he agreed to sign a “confession” by being made to stand for prolonged periods with his arms raised; beaten with an electric cable; struck in the face, back and stomach; and threatened that he would be raped by other prisoners.
