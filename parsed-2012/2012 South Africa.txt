Torture and other ill-treatment
In May, the Independent Police Investigative
Directorate (IPID) Act became law, but it was not operational by the end of the year. Under the Act, the
ICDâ€™s original mandatory investigation obligations were expanded to include incidents of torture and rape by police. Police failure to report suspected incidents or obstruction of ICD/IPID investigations were made criminal offences.
In July, the National Commissioner of correctional services ordered an internal inquiry into the alleged torture of a prisoner by six prison officers using an electric shock stun device. A police investigation was also instituted, but no progress had been reported by the end of the year.
A draft law to make torture a criminal offence had not been presented in Parliament by the end of the year.
