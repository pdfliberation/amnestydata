Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment in police custody remained widespread. In June, the Nepal-based
Centre for Victims of Torture reported that since the end of the armed conflict in 2006, the majority of incidents of torture were perpetrated by the police.
Of 989 prisoners interviewed, 74 per cent reported being tortured in custody.
Torture has yet to be criminalized under domestic
Nepalese law. During the first assessment of its human rights record under the UN Universal Periodic
Review, Nepal denied that systematic torture took place in the country, noting that a bill incorporating provisions of the Convention against Torture was“under  active consideration”.
