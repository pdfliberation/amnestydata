Torture and other ill-treatment
Slovakia was repeatedly reminded by the UN Human
Rights Committee that it should strengthen its efforts to combat racist attacks committed by law enforcement personnel, particularly against Roma. 
In September, the District Court in Ko코ice opened a hearing in the case of alleged ill-treatment of six
Romani boys by police officers in April 2009. The accused police officers and the parents of the Romani boys gave testimonies. The case was pending at the end of the year.
Guant치namo detainees
Two out of the three men formerly held in US custody in Guant치namo Bay, accepted by Slovakia in 2010, left for their native Tunisia and Egypt. One of them was reportedly arrested upon his arrival in Egypt in
June and charged with terrorism. The Minister of the
Interior stated that the departure of both men from
Slovakia was their choice. All three former
Guant치namo detainees had received residence permits in Slovakia in 2010. While waiting for these permits, they had been detained in a centre for illegal migrants where they went on hunger strike to protest against their detention and the living conditions.
