Torture and other ill-treatment
There were continuing reports of torture and other ill- treatment in police custody. The European Court of
Human Rights ruled in nine cases against Ukraine, finding that Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, which prohibits torture, had been violated. 
Firdovsi Safarov, a Ukrainian citizen of Azeri ethnic origin, told Amnesty International that, on 26 March, he had been beaten by six police officers from Mohiliov
Podilsky police station. He had been stopped by police officers while taking an old car to a scrap yard. He was punched in the head and racially abused. At the station, the Director and other police officers beat him intermittently until 1am, when he was released.
Firdovsi Safarov said that he had been asked to pay
US$3,000 to be released. He was later charged with resisting police officers, but was acquitted on 25 June.
Firdovsi Safarov lodged a complaint about the ill- treatment and, after two refusals, the Prosecutorâ€™s
Office opened an investigation in July. Although the investigation was ongoing, the Director of the police station remained in post at the end of the year. In
October, Firdovsi Safarov was rehospitalized due to the injuries he had received, but his treatment was stopped early, reportedly because police officers pressurized the doctors treating him.
