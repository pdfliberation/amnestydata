Torture and other ill-treatment
For the first time, members of the security forces were prosecuted under criminal anti-torture legislation.
Yet reports of torture and other ill-treatment by the security forces continued. Prosecutions of criminal suspects remained highly dependent on individual testimony, including forced confessions. 
In September, prosecutors filed the first criminal case under the Anti-Torture Law of 2009. The
Department of Justice recommended that criminal charges be filed against a senior police inspector and six other police officers. A mobile-phone video shot in2010  showed robbery suspect Darius Evangelista writhing in pain as the police inspector yanked
Evangelistaâ€™s penis with a cord; the video was broadcast on a television news programme in August that year. 
In August, four army rangers were arrested in connection with the alleged torture of Abdul Khan Ajid in July. They were accused of dousing him with gasoline and setting him alight to force him to confess to being a member of Abu Sayyaf. The four soldiers, including one officer, were relieved of their duties in
Basilan province, pending charges.
