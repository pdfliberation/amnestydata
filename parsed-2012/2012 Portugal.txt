Torture and other ill-treatment
In February, a video showing prison guards using a dart-firing stun gun against an inmate in Paços de
Ferreira prison in September 2010, allegedly to force him to clean his cell, was broadcast on the internet.
The man appeared to offer no resistance. In April, the
Minister of Justice issued a decree forbidding the use of stun guns in similar circumstances. An inquiry by the Audit and Inspection services of the General275Amnesty 
International Report 2012
Directorate for prisons was pending at the end of the year.
In March, the Court of Appeal of Evora confirmed an earlier ruling that Leonor Cipriano had been tortured while in police custody in 2004, but that it could not identify those responsible. Leonor Cipriano had yet to receive compensation from the state.
Gonçalo de Sousa Amaral and António Fernandes
Nuno Cardoso, senior officials in the judicial police, had been sentenced to 18 months’ and 27 months’ imprisonment respectively, for falsely claiming Leonor
Cipriano had fallen down the stairs. However, both sentences were suspended on the grounds that the officers had no previous criminal convictions.
Hearings in the trial of three police officers, accused of torturing Virgolino Borges while in police custody in March 2000, took place in November and
December. Virgolino Borges was asked to give his testimony again as the recording had allegedly been lost due to technical problems.
