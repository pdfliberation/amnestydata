Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment were committed by armed groups and government security forces, including the FARDC, the national police, the National
Intelligence Agency and the Republican Guard.
Security forces often committed torture and other ill-treatment in detention facilities following arbitrary arrests. NGOs and UN officials continued to be denied access to many facilities, and secret and unofficial holding cells were still in use.
In July, the DRC promulgated a law criminalizing torture. Implementing this legislation remained a key challenge as security services continued to commit torture and other ill-treatment, including in illegal detention facilities. 
Between 27 July and 1 August, during a military operation in Rutshuru territory, North Kivu, FARDC soldiers reportedly arbitrarily arrested 27 people as a reprisal for alleged FDLR collaboration. At least eight of them were allegedly subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and forced labour. 
On 13 April, in Vusamba, Lubero territory, North
Kivu, a PNC detainee was whipped 40 times before being freed because he could not pay the US$40 requested for his release.
