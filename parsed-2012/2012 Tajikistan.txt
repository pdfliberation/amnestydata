Torture and other ill-treatment
Police and security forces continued to use torture and other ill-treatment with almost total impunity, despite changes to the law in 2010. The European
Court of Human Rights issued emergency measures to prevent the extradition of a man to Tajikistan, due to the prevalence of torture in the country. At the end of the year the government announced its intention to amend the Criminal Code with a definition of torture, in line with international law. 
Safarali Sangov died on 5 March, four days after being arrested by police officers of the Sino District in
Dushanbe. During the arrest, police reportedly beat him and other family members, including children and a woman who was four months pregnant. Following a public outcry and allegations that Safarali Sangov died as a result of torture at the police station, two policemen were charged in March with “negligence” and one with“exceeding  authority”. However, the prosecution subsequently dropped the latter charge, stating that testimonies of Safarali Sangov’s relatives were not acceptable as evidence. After a legal battle, the case was transferred to the General Prosecutor’s office for review. 
The trial against Ilhom Ismonov and 52 co- defendants began on 11 July at Soghd Regional Court in northern Tajikistan. All were accused of membership of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and of participating in organized crime. On 19 July, he and several others told the judge that they had been tortured in pre-trial detention. On 16 September, Ilhom
Ismonov told the judge that he had been pressurized by officials to retract his earlier allegations of torture and other ill-treatment. He had not dared speak out earlier, fearing retaliation from law enforcement agencies. The judge ignored his statement. His confession, allegedly obtained under torture, was used as evidence against him. The Prosecutor requested a 12-year prison sentence. The case was ongoing at the end of the year.
