Torture and other ill-treatment
Cases of torture and other ill-treatment by the judicial police were reported.
The government had still not established an independent monitoring body to visit prisons and detention centres, breaching a requirement of the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against
Torture, which Lebanon ratified in 2008. 
In April, four inmates of Roumieh Prison in Beirut died in unclear circumstances when security forces quelled a protest by detainees against overcrowding and prolonged pre-trial detention. The Interior Minister appointed the head of the ISF to conduct an inquiry, but its outcome was not made public.
