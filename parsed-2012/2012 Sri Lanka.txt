Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and other ill-treatment of criminal suspects and those detained on suspicion of links to the LTTE remained widespread, despite laws prohibiting torture.
Rape and other gender-based violence amounting to torture were not taken seriously by the authorities.
Sexual violence went largely under-reported and, where reported, was poorly investigated.
