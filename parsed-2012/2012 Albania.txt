Torture and other ill-treatment
Commissioners of the Ombudsperson’s Office visited
Tirana police stations and detention centres following the January demonstrations. They stated that detained demonstrators, two of whom bore marks of physical ill-treatment, alleged being ill-treated during arrest, and that psychological pressure had been used to make them sign self-incriminating statements.
Nine complaints of police ill-treatment were reportedly filed. In February, the Internal Control Service of the
State Police undertook to investigate complaints, but by the end of the year no perpetrators had been brought to justice. 
The Ombudsperson wrote to the Prosecutor General raising the case of Reis Haxhiraj, who was allegedly severely ill-treated during his arrest in March. The
Ombudsperson stated that although his injuries were58 
clearly visible, and he had complained of ill-treatment when brought before a judge to be remanded in custody, neither the police, prosecutor, judge or hospital staff had reported his ill-treatment or initiated an investigation. His requests to contact the
Ombudsperson’s Office were ignored. The Prosecutor
General subsequently instructed prosecutors and officers of the judicial police to collect evidence on the ill-treatment of detainees, in order to bring those responsible to justice, and an investigation was started into the alleged ill-treatment of Reis Haxhiraj.
